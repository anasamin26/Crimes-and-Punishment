It would be interesting to know what it is \\nmen are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new \\nword is what they fear most…. But I am talking too much. \\nIt’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that \\nI chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this \\nlast month, lying for days together in my den thinking … \\nof Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I \\ncapable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It’s \\nsimply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe \\nit is a plaything.’\\nThe heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the \\nbustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about \\nhim, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all \\nwho are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked \\npainfully upon the young man’s already overwrought \\nnerves. The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which \\nare particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the \\ndrunken men whom he met continually, although it was a \\nworking day, completed the revolting misery of the picture. \\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAn expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a mo -\\nment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, \\nexceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, \\nwell-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. \\nSoon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak -\\ning into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not \\nobserving what was about him and not caring to observe it. \\nFrom time to time, he would mutter something, from the \\nhabit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. \\nAt these moments he would become conscious that his ideas \\nwere sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for \\ntwo days he had scarcely tasted food.\\nHe was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to \\nshabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street \\nin such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarce -\\nly any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. \\nOwing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of \\nestablishments of bad character, the preponderance of the \\ntrading and working class population crowded in these \\nstreets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so vari -\\nous were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however \\nqueer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accu -\\nmulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, \\nthat, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded \\nhis rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter \\nwhen he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu -\\ndents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And \\nyet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, \\nwas being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a Crime and Punishment 10heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: \\n‘Hey there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice \\nand pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly \\nand clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat \\nfrom Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with \\nage, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side \\nin a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite \\nanother feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.\\n‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s \\nthe worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial \\ndetail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too notice -\\nable…. It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable…. With \\nmy rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but \\nnot this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would \\nbe noticed a mile off, it would be remembered…. What mat -\\nters is that people would remember it, and that would give \\nthem a clue. For this business one should be as little con -\\nspicuous as possible…. Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, \\nit’s just such trifles that always ruin everything….’\\nHe had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps \\nit was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven \\nhundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he \\nhad been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith \\nin those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their \\nhideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had \\nbegun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the \\nmonologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and \\nindecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this ‘hid -\\neous’ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still 11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdid not realise this himself. He was positively going now for \\na ‘rehearsal’ of his project, and at every step his excitement \\ngrew more and more violent.\\nWith a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up \\nto a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, \\nand on the other into the street. This house was let out in \\ntiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all \\nkinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls \\npicking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There \\nwas a continual coming and going through the two gates \\nand in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-\\nkeepers were employed on the building. The young man \\nwas very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un -\\nnoticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. \\nIt was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar \\nwith it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur -\\nroundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes \\nwere not to be dreaded.\\n‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow \\ncame to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not \\nhelp asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There \\nhis progress was barred by some porters who were engaged \\nin moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had \\nbeen occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and \\nhis family. This German was moving out then, and so the \\nfourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by \\nthe old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to \\nhimself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell \\ngave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of Crime and Punishment 1\\x18copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells that \\nring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and \\nnow its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something \\nand to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves \\nwere terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door \\nwas opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor \\nwith evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could \\nbe seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch -\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit -\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round \\nher thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot -\\nted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there \\nhung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow \\nwith age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in -\\nstant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather \\npeculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her \\neyes again.\\n‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the \\nyoung man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem -\\nbering that he ought to be more polite.\\n‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your \\ncoming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping \\nher inquiring eyes on his face.1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol -\\nnikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at \\nthe old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that \\nthough, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought \\nwith an uneasy feeling.\\nThe old woman paused, as though hesitating; then \\nstepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, \\nshe said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:\\n‘Step in, my good sir.’\\nThe little room into which the young man walked, with \\nyellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains \\nin the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by \\nthe setting sun.\\n‘So the sun will shine like this then  too!’ flashed as it were \\nby chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid \\nglance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as \\npossible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there \\nwas nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all.

There was not \\na speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.\\n‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds Crime and Punishment 1\\x18such cleanliness,’ Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole \\na curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading \\ninto another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed \\nand chest of drawers and into which he had never looked \\nbefore. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\\n‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com -\\ning into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so \\nas to look him straight in the face.\\n‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out \\nof his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back \\nof which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.\\n‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up \\nthe day before yesterday.’\\n‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a \\nlittle.’\\n‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or \\nto sell your pledge at once.’\\n‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva -\\nnovna?’\\n‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely \\nworth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your \\nring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou -\\nble and a half.’\\n‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my \\nfather’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’\\n‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’\\n‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.\\n‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back \\nthe watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he 1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, \\nremembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and \\nthat he had had another object also in coming.\\n‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.\\nThe old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and \\ndisappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The \\nyoung man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, \\nlistened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock -\\ning the chest of drawers.\\n‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries \\nthe keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel \\nring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all \\nthe others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the \\nchest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or \\nstrong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always \\nhave keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’\\nThe old woman came back.\\n‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so \\nI must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the \\nmonth in advance. But for the two roubles I lent you before, \\nyou owe me now twenty copecks on the same reckoning \\nin advance. That makes thirty-five copecks altogether. So \\nI must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. \\nHere it is.’\\n‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’\\n‘Just so.’\\nThe young man did not dispute it and took the money. \\nHe looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get \\naway, as though there was still something he wanted to say Crime and Punishment 1\\x18or to do, but he did not himself quite know what.\\n‘I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, \\nAlyona Ivanovna —a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-\\nbox, as soon as I get it back from a friend …’ he broke off in \\nconfusion.\\n‘Well, we will talk about it then, sir.’\\n‘Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is \\nnot here with you?’ He asked her as casually as possible as \\nhe went out into the passage.\\n‘What business is she of yours, my good sir?’\\n‘Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too \\nquick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’\\nRaskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con -\\nfusion became more and more intense. As he went down the \\nstairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though \\nsuddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street \\nhe cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, \\ncan I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added \\nresolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come \\ninto my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, \\nfilthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for \\na whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, \\ncould express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, \\nwhich had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he \\nwas on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such \\na pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not \\nknow what to do with himself to escape from his wretched -\\nness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and 1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look -\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or -\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth -\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo -\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con -\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time. Their departure left the room \\nquiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were Crime and Punishment 1\\x18a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex -\\ntremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, \\na huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted \\ncoat.

He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, \\nregardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and 1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look -\\ning round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern \\nwhich was entered by steps leading from the pavement to \\nthe basement. At that instant two drunken men came out \\nat the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they \\nmounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov \\nwent down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never \\nbeen into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented \\nby a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and \\nattributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat \\ndown at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or -\\ndered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At \\nonce he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.\\n‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth -\\ning in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. \\nJust a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo -\\nment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will \\nis firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’\\nBut in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now \\nlooking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from \\na terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at \\nthe people in the room. But even at that moment he had a \\ndim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also \\nnot normal.\\nThere were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides \\nthe two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con -\\nsisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had \\ngone out at the same time. Their departure left the room \\nquiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were Crime and Punishment 1\\x18a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex -\\ntremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, \\na huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted \\ncoat. He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the \\nbench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, \\ncracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the up -\\nper part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he \\nhummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some \\nsuch lines as these:\\n‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—\\nfondly loved.’\\nOr suddenly waking up again:\\n‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used \\nto know.’\\nBut no one shared his enjoyment: his silent compan -\\nion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these \\nmanifestations. There was another man in the room who \\nlooked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He was \\nsitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and look -\\ning round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some \\nagitation.1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter II\\nRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said be -\\nfore, he avoided society of every sort, more especially \\nof late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other \\npeople. Something new seemed to be taking place within \\nhim, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was \\nso weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness \\nand gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a \\nmoment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in \\nspite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now \\nto stay in the tavern.\\nThe master of the establishment was in another room, but \\nhe frequently came down some steps into the main room, \\nhis jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming \\ninto view each time before the rest of his person. He wore \\na full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with \\nno cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like \\nan iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, \\nand there was another boy somewhat younger who handed \\nwhatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cu -\\ncumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, \\nchopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably \\nclose, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five min -\\nutes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\\nThere are chance meetings with strangers that interest Crime and Punishment \\x180us from the first moment, before a word is spoken. Such \\nwas the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sit -\\nting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired \\nclerk. The young man often recalled this impression af -\\nterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked \\nrepeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter \\nwas staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter \\ninto conversation. At the other persons in the room, includ -\\ning the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were \\nused to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of \\ncondescending contempt for them as persons of station and \\nculture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless \\nfor him to converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and griz -\\nzled, of medium height, and stoutly built. His face, bloated \\nfrom continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, \\ntinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes \\ngleamed like little chinks. But there was something very \\nstrange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of \\nintense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intel -\\nligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something \\nlike madness. He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged \\nblack dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, \\nand that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this \\nlast trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered \\nwith spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. \\nLike a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been \\nso long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish \\nbrush. And there was something respectable and like an of -\\nficial about his manner too. But he was restless; he ruffled \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comup his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his \\nhands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained \\nand sticky table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, \\nand said loudly and resolutely:\\n‘May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con -\\nversation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not \\ncommand respect, my experience admonishes me that you \\nare a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.

For \\nhe knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compas -\\nsion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern \\nideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden \\nnowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now \\nin England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know before -\\nhand that he won’t, I set off to him and …’\\n‘Why do you go?’ put in Raskolnikov.\\n‘Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! \\nFor every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are \\ntimes when one absolutely must go somewhere! When my \\nown daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had \\nto go … (for my daughter has a yellow passport),’ he add -\\ned in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the \\nyoung man. ‘No matter, sir, no matter!’ he went on hurried -\\nly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the \\ncounter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—‘No mat -\\nter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for \\neveryone knows everything about it already, and all that is \\nsecret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, \\nbut with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Ex -\\ncuse me, young man, can you…. No, to put it more strongly \\nand more distinctly; not can you but dare  you, looking upon \\nme, assert that I am not a pig?’\\nThe young man did not answer a word.\\n‘Well,’ the orator began again stolidly and with even in -\\ncreased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room \\nto subside. ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I \\nhave the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my \\nspouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. \\nGranted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of \\na noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And \\nyet … oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, \\nyou know every man ought to have at least one place where \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.compeople feel for him! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is \\nmagnanimous, she is unjust…. And yet, although I realise \\nthat when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for \\nI repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young \\nman,’ he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the snig -\\ngering again—‘but, my God, if she would but once…. But \\nno, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no use talking! No use talk -\\ning! For more than once, my wish did come true and more \\nthan once she has felt for me but … such is my fate and I am \\na beast by nature!’\\n‘Rather!’ assented the innkeeper yawning.

For, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spir -\\nited lady, irritable and short—tempered…. Yes. But it’s no \\nuse going over that!

I did make an effort four years ago to give her \\na course of geography and universal history, but as I was \\nnot very well up in those subjects myself and we had no \\nsuitable books, and what books we had … hm, anyway we \\nhave not even those now, so all our instruction came to an \\nend.

And now may I ven -\\nture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with \\na private question. Do you suppose that a respectable poor \\ngirl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen farthings a \\nday can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special tal -\\nent and that without putting her work down for an instant! \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAnd what’s more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsel -\\nlor—have you heard of him?—has not to this day paid her \\nfor the half-dozen linen shirts she made him and drove her \\nroughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the pretext that \\nthe shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were \\nput in askew. And there are the little ones hungry…. And \\nKaterina Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her \\nhands, her cheeks flushed red, as they always are in that dis -\\nease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says she, ‘you eat and drink and \\nare kept warm and you do nothing to help.’ And much she \\ngets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the little \\nones for three days! I was lying at the time … well, what of \\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she \\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice … fair hair and \\nsuch a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, \\nam I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsov -\\nna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the \\npolice, had two or three times tried to get at her through \\nthe landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with \\na jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful \\nof!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t \\nblame her! She was not herself when she spoke, but driven \\nto distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry \\nchildren; and it was said more to wound her than anything \\nelse…. For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when \\nchildren cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them \\nat once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her ker -\\nchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine \\no’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina Crime and Punishment \\x180Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her \\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at \\nher, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames  shawl \\n(we have a shawl, made of drap de dames ), put it over her \\nhead and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the \\nwall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shudder -\\ning…. And I went on lying there, just as before…. And then \\nI saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same si -\\nlence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the \\nevening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then \\nthey both fell asleep in each other’s arms … together, to -\\ngether … yes … and I … lay drunk.’\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had \\nfailed him.

I was lying at the time … well, what of \\nit! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she \\nis a gentle creature with a soft little voice … fair hair and \\nsuch a pale, thin little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, \\nam I really to do a thing like that?’ And Darya Frantsov -\\nna, a woman of evil character and very well known to the \\npolice, had two or three times tried to get at her through \\nthe landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with \\na jeer, ‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful \\nof!’ But don’t blame her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t \\nblame her! She was not herself when she spoke, but driven \\nto distraction by her illness and the crying of the hungry \\nchildren; and it was said more to wound her than anything \\nelse…. For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when \\nchildren cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them \\nat once. At six o’clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her ker -\\nchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine \\no’clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina Crime and Punishment \\x180Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her \\nin silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at \\nher, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames  shawl \\n(we have a shawl, made of drap de dames ), put it over her \\nhead and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the \\nwall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shudder -\\ning…. And I went on lying there, just as before…. And then \\nI saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same si -\\nlence go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the \\nevening kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then \\nthey both fell asleep in each other’s arms … together, to -\\ngether … yes … and I … lay drunk.’\\nMarmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had \\nfailed him. Then he hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and \\ncleared his throat.\\n‘Since then, sir,’ he went on after a brief pause—‘Since \\nthen, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through in -\\nformation given by evil- intentioned persons—in all which \\nDarya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that \\nshe had been treated with want of respect—since then my \\ndaughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yel -\\nlow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living \\nwith us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not \\nhear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna be -\\nfore) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too … hm…. All the trouble \\nbetween him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s ac -\\ncount. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and \\nthen all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, \\n‘can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwith a girl like that?’ And Katerina Ivanovna would not let \\nit pass, she stood up for her … and so that’s how it hap -\\npened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she \\ncomforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can…. \\nShe has a room at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges \\nwith them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate \\nand all of his numerous family have cleft palates too. And \\nhis wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one room, \\nbut Sonia has her own, partitioned off…. Hm … yes … very \\npoor people and all with cleft palates … yes. Then I got up \\nin the morning, and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to \\nheaven and set off to his excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His \\nexcellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you know him? No? Well, \\nthen, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax … wax \\nbefore the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth! … His eyes \\nwere dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once al -\\nready you have deceived my expectations … I’ll take you \\nonce more on my own responsibility’—that’s what he said, \\n‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you can go.’ I kissed the dust \\nat his feet—in thought only, for in reality he would not have \\nallowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of modern \\npolitical and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when \\nI announced that I’d been taken back into the service and \\nshould receive a salary, heavens, what a to-do there was …!’\\nMarmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At \\nthat moment a whole party of revellers already drunk came \\nin from the street, and the sounds of a hired concertina and \\nthe cracked piping voice of a child of seven singing ‘The \\nHamlet’ were heard in the entry. The room was filled with Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the \\nnew-comers. Marmeladov paying no attention to the new \\narrivals continued his story. He appeared by now to be ex -\\ntremely weak, but as he became more and more drunk, he \\nbecame more and more talkative. The recollection of his re -\\ncent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, \\nand was positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. \\nRaskolnikov listened attentively.\\n‘That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes…. As soon as Kateri -\\nna Ivanovna and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as \\nthough I stepped into the kingdom of Heaven. It used to \\nbe: you can lie like a beast, nothing but abuse. Now they \\nwere walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon Za -\\nharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, \\nshh!’ They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled \\ncream for me! They began to get real cream for me, do you \\nhear that? And how they managed to get together the mon -\\ney for a decent outfit— eleven roubles, fifty copecks, I can’t \\nguess. Boots, cotton shirt- fronts—most magnificent, a uni -\\nform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and \\na half. The first morning I came back from the office I found \\nKaterina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner—\\nsoup and salt meat with horse radish—which we had never \\ndreamed of till then. She had not any dresses … none at all, \\nbut she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; \\nand not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened her -\\nself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on \\na clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a \\ndifferent person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commy little darling, had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ \\nshe said, ‘it won’t do for me to come and see you too often. \\nAfter dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do you hear, do \\nyou hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you \\nthink: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last \\ndegree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week \\nbefore, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. For \\ntwo hours they were sitting, whispering together. ‘Semyon \\nZaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a \\nsalary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his excellency and \\nhis excellency himself came out to him, made all the others \\nwait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before every -\\nbody into his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ \\nsays he, ‘Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past ser -\\nvices,’ says he, ‘and in spite of your propensity to that foolish \\nweakness, since you promise now and since moreover we’ve \\ngot on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you hear;) ‘and \\nso,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And \\nall that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, \\nand not simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; \\nno, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her \\nown fancies, upon my word she does! And I don’t blame her \\nfor it, no, I don’t blame her! … Six days ago when I brought \\nher my first earnings in full—twenty-three roubles forty co -\\npecks altogether—she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said \\nshe, ‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you \\nunderstand? You would not think me a beauty, you would \\nnot think much of me as a husband, would you? … Well, \\nshe pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’ said she.’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his \\nchin began to twitch. He controlled himself however. The \\ntavern, the degraded appearance of the man, the five nights \\nin the hay barge, and the pot of spirits, and yet this poignant \\nlove for his wife and children bewildered his listener. Ras -\\nkolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.

But a minute later his face suddenly changed \\nand with a certain assumed slyness and affectation of bra -\\nvado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\\n‘This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a \\npick-me-up! He-he-he!’\\n‘You don’t say she gave it to you?’ cried one of the new-\\ncomers; he shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\\n‘This very quart was bought with her money,’ Marmeladov \\ndeclared, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. \\n‘Thirty copecks she gave me with her own hands, her last, \\nall she had, as I saw….

And I have already drunk it! Come, who will \\nhave pity on a man like me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry or not? He-he-he!’\\nHe would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. \\nThe pot was empty.\\n‘What are you to be pitied for?’ shouted the tavern-keeper \\nwho was again near them.\\nShouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter \\nand the oaths came from those who were listening and also \\nfrom those who had heard nothing but were simply looking \\nat the figure of the discharged government clerk.\\n‘To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?’ Marmeladov sud -\\ndenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as \\nthough he had been only waiting for that question.\\n‘Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to \\npity me for! I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not \\npitied! Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And \\nthen I will go of myself to be crucified, for it’s not merry-\\nmaking I seek but tears and tribulation! … Do you suppose, \\nyou that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me?

And He will judge and will \\nforgive all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek…. \\nAnd when He has done with all of them, then He will sum -\\nmon us. ‘You too come forth,’ He will say, ‘Come forth ye \\ndrunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come forth, ye chil -\\ndren of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame \\nand shall stand before him.

Then we shall understand all! … and all \\nwill understand, Katerina Ivanovna even … she will under -\\nstand….

His words had created a certain impression; there \\nwas a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were \\nheard again.\\n‘That’s his notion!’\\n‘Talked himself silly!’\\n‘A fine clerk he is!’\\nAnd so on, and so on.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18‘Let us go, sir,’ said Marmeladov all at once, raising his \\nhead and addressing Raskolnikov—‘come along with me … \\nKozel’s house, looking into the yard.

It was all in disorder, littered up with rags of all \\nsorts, especially children’s garments. Across the furthest \\ncorner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it probably was \\nthe bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs \\nand a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, be -\\nfore which stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and \\nuncovered. At the edge of the table stood a smoldering \\ntallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It appeared that the \\nfamily had a room to themselves, not part of a room, but \\ntheir room was practically a passage. The door leading to \\nthe other rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia \\nLippevechsel’s flat was divided stood half open, and there \\nwas shouting, uproar and laughter within. People seemed to \\nbe playing cards and drinking tea there. Words of the most \\nunceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\\nRaskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She \\nwas a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaci -\\nated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic \\nflush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down in her little \\nroom, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips were \\nparched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. \\nHer eyes glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh \\nimmovable stare. And that consumptive and excited face \\nwith the last flickering light of the candle-end playing upon Crime and Punishment \\x180it made a sickening impression. She seemed to Raskolnikov \\nabout thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for \\nMarmeladov…. She had not heard them and did not notice \\nthem coming in. She seemed to be lost in thought, hear -\\ning and seeing nothing. The room was close, but she had \\nnot opened the window; a stench rose from the staircase, \\nbut the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner \\nrooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept cough -\\ning, but did not close the door. The youngest child, a girl of \\nsix, was asleep, sitting curled up on the floor with her head \\non the sofa. A boy a year older stood crying and shaking in \\nthe corner, probably he had just had a beating. Beside him \\nstood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin, wearing a thin \\nand ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung \\nover her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reach -\\ning her knees. Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her \\nbrother’s neck. She was trying to comfort him, whispering \\nsomething to him, and doing all she could to keep him from \\nwhimpering again. At the same time her large dark eyes, \\nwhich looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened \\nface, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov \\ndid not enter the door, but dropped on his knees in the very \\ndoorway, pushing Raskolnikov in front of him. The woman \\nseeing a stranger stopped indifferently facing him, coming \\nto herself for a moment and apparently wondering what he \\nhad come for. But evidently she decided that he was going \\ninto the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get \\nthere. Taking no further notice of him, she walked towards \\nthe outer door to close it and uttered a sudden scream on \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comseeing her husband on his knees in the doorway.\\n‘Ah!’ she cried out in a frenzy, ‘he has come back! The \\ncriminal! the monster! … And where is the money? What’s \\nin your pocket, show me! And your clothes are all different! \\nWhere are your clothes? Where is the money! Speak!’\\nAnd she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively \\nand obediently held up both arms to facilitate the search. \\nNot a farthing was there.\\n‘Where is the money?’ she cried—‘Mercy on us, can he \\nhave drunk it all? There were twelve silver roubles left in the \\nchest!’ and in a fury she seized him by the hair and dragged \\nhim into the room. Marmeladov seconded her efforts by \\nmeekly crawling along on his knees.\\n‘And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, \\nbut is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,’ he called \\nout, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking \\nthe ground with his forehead. The child asleep on the floor \\nwoke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all \\ncontrol began trembling and screaming and rushed to his \\nsister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was \\nshaking like a leaf.\\n‘He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,’ the poor woman \\nscreamed in despair —‘and his clothes are gone! And they \\nare hungry, hungry!’—and wringing her hands she point -\\ned to the children. ‘Oh, accursed life! And you, are you not \\nashamed?’—she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov—\\n‘from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You \\nhave been drinking with him, too! Go away!’\\nThe young man was hastening away without uttering a Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18word. The inner door was thrown wide open and inquisitive \\nfaces were peering in at it. Coarse laughing faces with pipes \\nand cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust themselves in \\nat the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in dress -\\ning gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, \\nsome of them with cards in their hands. They were particu -\\nlarly diverted, when Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, \\nshouted that it was a consolation to him.

But his \\nsleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, ir -\\nritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room. \\nIt was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. \\nIt had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow \\npaper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that \\na man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and \\nfelt every moment that he would knock his head against the \\nceiling. The furniture was in keeping with the room: there \\nwere three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the \\ncorner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust \\nthat lay thick upon them showed that they had been long \\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole \\nof one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once \\ncovered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Ras -\\nkolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep on it, as he was, \\nwithout undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old \\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under \\nwhich he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by \\nway of a bolster. A little table stood in front of the sofa.\\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of \\ndisorder, but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind \\nthis was positively agreeable. He had got completely away \\nfrom everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comof a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked \\nsometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous \\nirritation. He was in the condition that overtakes some \\nmonomaniacs entirely concentrated upon one thing. His \\nlandlady had for the last fortnight given up sending him \\nin meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with \\nher, though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook \\nand only servant, was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood \\nand had entirely given up sweeping and doing his room, \\nonly once a week or so she would stray into his room with a \\nbroom. She waked him up that day.\\n‘Get up, why are you asleep?’ she called to him. ‘It’s past \\nnine, I have brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I \\nshould think you’re fairly starving?’\\nRaskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised \\nNastasya.\\n‘From the landlady, eh?’ he asked, slowly and with a sick -\\nly face sitting up on the sofa.\\n‘From the landlady, indeed!’\\nShe set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak \\nand stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side \\nof it.\\n‘Here, Nastasya, take it please,’ he said, fumbling in his \\npocket (for he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a \\nhandful of coppers—‘run and buy me a loaf. And get me a \\nlittle sausage, the cheapest, at the pork-butcher’s.’\\n‘The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you \\nrather have some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capi -\\ntal soup, yesterday’s. I saved it for you yesterday, but you Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18came in late. It’s fine soup.’\\nWhen the soup had been brought, and he had begun \\nupon it, Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and be -\\ngan chatting. She was a country peasant-woman and a very \\ntalkative one.\\n‘Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police \\nabout you,’ she said.\\nHe scowled.\\n‘To the police? What does she want?’\\n‘You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the \\nroom. That’s what she wants, to be sure.’\\n‘The devil, that’s the last straw,’ he muttered, grinding his \\nteeth, ‘no, that would not suit me … just now. She is a fool,’ \\nhe added aloud. ‘I’ll go and talk to her to-day.’\\n‘Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you \\nare so clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to \\nshow for it? One time you used to go out, you say, to teach \\nchildren. But why is it you do nothing now?’\\n‘I am doing …’ Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluc -\\ntantly.\\n‘What are you doing?’\\n‘Work …’\\n‘What sort of work?’\\n‘I am thinking,’ he answered seriously after a pause.\\nNastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter.

In the first place, would you have \\nguessed, dear Rodya, that your sister has been living with \\nme for the last six weeks and we shall not be separated in \\nthe future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will tell \\nyou everything in order, so that you may know just how ev -\\nerything has happened and all that we have hitherto \\nconcealed from you. When you wrote to me two months \\nago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put \\nup with in the Svidrigraïlovs’ house, when you wrote that \\nand asked me to tell you all about it—what could I write in \\nanswer to you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I \\ndare say you would have thrown up everything and have \\ncome to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know \\nyour character and your feelings, and you would not let \\nyour sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what \\ncould I do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth \\nmyself then. What made it all so difficult was that Dounia \\nreceived a hundred roubles in advance when she took the \\nplace as governess in their family, on condition of part of \\nher salary being deducted every month, and so it was im -\\npossible to throw up the situation without repaying the \\ndebt. This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious \\nRodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, \\nwhich you needed so terribly then and which you received \\nfrom us last year. We deceived you then, writing that this \\nmoney came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not so, \\nand now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things \\nhave suddenly changed for the better, and that you may \\nknow how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has. At Crime and Punishment \\x180first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated her very rudely and \\nused to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table…. \\nBut I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as not \\nto worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in \\nspite of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, \\nMr. Svidrigaïlov’s wife, and all the rest of the household, \\nDounia had a very hard time, especially when Mr. Svidriga -\\nïlov, relapsing into his old regimental habits, was under the \\ninfluence of Bacchus. And how do you think it was all ex -\\nplained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow \\nhad conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, \\nbut had concealed it under a show of rudeness and con -\\ntempt. Possibly he was ashamed and horrified himself at his \\nown flighty hopes, considering his years and his being the \\nfather of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia. \\nAnd possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behav -\\niour to hide the truth from others. But at last he lost all \\ncontrol and had the face to make Dounia an open and \\nshameful proposal, promising her all sorts of inducements \\nand offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her \\nto another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all \\nshe went through! To leave her situation at once was impos -\\nsible not only on account of the money debt, but also to \\nspare the feelings of Marfa Petrovna, whose suspicions \\nwould have been aroused: and then Dounia would have \\nbeen the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would have \\nmeant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have \\nbeen inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to \\nwhich Dounia could not hope to escape from that awful \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhouse for another six weeks. You know Dounia, of course; \\nyou know how clever she is and what a strong will she has. \\nDounia can endure a great deal and even in the most diffi -\\ncult cases she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. \\nShe did not even write to me about everything for fear of \\nupsetting me, although we were constantly in communica -\\ntion. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa Petrovna \\naccidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in \\nthe garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on \\nthe position, threw the blame upon her, believing her to be \\nthe cause of it all. An awful scene took place between them \\non the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to \\nstrike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting \\nat her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia \\nshould be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, \\ninto which they flung all her things, her linen and her \\nclothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it. \\nAnd a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, in -\\nsulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an \\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think \\nnow what answer could I have sent to the letter I received \\nfrom you two months ago and what could I have written? I \\nwas in despair; I dared not write to you the truth because \\nyou would have been very unhappy, mortified and indig -\\nnant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps \\nruin yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and \\nfill up my letter with trifles when my heart was so full of \\nsorrow, I could not. For a whole month the town was full of \\ngossip about this scandal, and it came to such a pass that Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account of the \\ncontemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made \\naloud about us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody \\neven bowed to us in the street, and I learnt that some shop -\\nmen and clerks were intending to insult us in a shameful \\nway, smearing the gates of our house with pitch, so that the \\nlandlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set go -\\ning by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia \\nand throw dirt at her in every family. She knows everyone \\nin the neighbourhood, and that month she was continually \\ncoming into the town, and as she is rather talkative and \\nfond of gossiping about her family affairs and particularly \\nof complaining to all and each of her husband—which is \\nnot at all right —so in a short time she had spread her story \\nnot only in the town, but over the whole surrounding dis -\\ntrict. It made me ill, but Dounia bore it better than I did, \\nand if only you could have seen how she endured it all and \\ntried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is an angel! But by \\nGod’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nreturned to his senses and repented and, probably feeling \\nsorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete \\nand unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form \\nof a letter Dounia had been forced to write and give to him, \\nbefore Marfa Petrovna came upon them in the garden. This \\nletter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her \\ndeparture, she had written to refuse personal explanations \\nand secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. In \\nthat letter she reproached him with great heat and indigna -\\ntion for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comPetrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of \\na family and telling him how infamous it was of him to tor -'), Document(page_content='on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna went so far as to \\nstrike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was shouting \\nat her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia \\nshould be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, \\ninto which they flung all her things, her linen and her \\nclothes, all pell-mell, without folding it up and packing it. \\nAnd a heavy shower of rain came on, too, and Dounia, in -\\nsulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an \\nopen cart all the seventeen versts into town.

This \\nletter, which remained in Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her \\ndeparture, she had written to refuse personal explanations \\nand secret interviews, for which he was entreating her. In \\nthat letter she reproached him with great heat and indigna -\\ntion for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comPetrovna, reminding him that he was the father and head of \\na family and telling him how infamous it was of him to tor -\\nment and make unhappy a defenceless girl, unhappy enough \\nalready. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and \\ntouchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this \\nday I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence \\nof the servants, too, cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had \\nseen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidrigaïlov \\nhad himself supposed —as indeed is always the case with \\nservants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and \\n‘again crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was com -\\npletely convinced of Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, \\nbeing Sunday, she went straight to the Cathedral, knelt \\ndown and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give her strength \\nto bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she came \\nstraight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, \\nwept bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and \\nbesought her to forgive her. The same morning without any \\ndelay, she went round to all the houses in the town and ev -\\nerywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in the most flattering \\nterms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings \\nand her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to \\neveryone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. \\nSvidrigaïlov and even allowed them to take copies of it—\\nwhich I must say I think was superfluous. In this way she \\nwas busy for several days in driving about the whole town, \\nbecause some people had taken offence through precedence \\nhaving been given to others. And therefore they had to take \\nturns, so that in every house she was expected before she ar -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18rived, and everyone knew that on such and such a day \\nMarfa Petrovna would be reading the letter in such and \\nsuch a place and people assembled for every reading of it, \\neven many who had heard it several times already both in \\ntheir own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a \\ngreat deal, a very great deal of all this was unnecessary; but \\nthat’s Marfa Petrovna’s character. Anyway she succeeded in \\ncompletely re-establishing Dounia’s reputation and the \\nwhole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible disgrace \\nupon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I re -\\nally began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the \\ncrazy fellow too harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give \\nlessons in several families, but she refused. All of a sudden \\neveryone began to treat her with marked respect and all \\nthis did much to bring about the event by which, one may \\nsay, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must \\nknow, dear Rodya, that Dounia has a suitor and that she has \\nalready consented to marry him. I hasten to tell you all \\nabout the matter, and though it has been arranged without \\nasking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved with \\nme or with your sister on that account, for you will see that \\nwe could not wait and put off our decision till we heard \\nfrom you. And you could not have judged all the facts with -\\nout being on the spot. This was how it happened. He is \\nalready of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, \\nand is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who has been \\nvery active in bringing the match about. It began with his \\nexpressing through her his desire to make our acquain -\\ntance. He was properly received, drank coffee with us and \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthe very next day he sent us a letter in which he very courte -\\nously made an offer and begged for a speedy and decided \\nanswer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry to get \\nto Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At \\nfirst, of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all hap -\\npened so quickly and unexpectedly. We thought and talked \\nit over the whole day. He is a well-to-do man, to be depend -\\ned upon, he has two posts in the government and has already \\nmade his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years old, but \\nhe is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be \\nthought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very re -\\nspectable and presentable man, only he seems a little morose \\nand somewhat conceited. But possibly that may only be the \\nimpression he makes at first sight.

I must add that he expressed it more nicely \\nand politely than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual \\nphrases and only remember the meaning. And, besides, it \\nwas obviously not said of design, but slipped out in the heat \\nof conversation, so that he tried afterwards to correct him -\\nself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike me as \\nsomewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But \\nDounia was vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ \\nand that, of course, is perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep \\nall night before she made up her mind, and, thinking that I \\nwas asleep, she got out of bed and was walking up and down \\nthe room all night; at last she knelt down before the ikon \\nand prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told \\nme that she had decided.\\n‘I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just \\nsetting off for Petersburg, where he has a great deal of busi -\\nness, and he wants to open a legal bureau. He has been \\noccupied for many years in conducting civil and commer -\\ncial litigation, and only the other day he won an important \\ncase. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an impor -\\ntant case before the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the \\ngreatest use to you, in every way indeed, and Dounia and I \\nhave agreed that from this very day you could definitely en -\\nter upon your career and might consider that your future is \\nmarked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to \\npass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look \\nupon it as a providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of \\nnothing else. We have even ventured already to drop a few \\nwords on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch. He was cautious in Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not get on \\nwithout a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary \\nto a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted \\nfor the duties (as though there could be doubt of your being \\nfitted!) but then he expressed doubts whether your studies \\nat the university would leave you time for work at his office. \\nThe matter dropped for the time, but Dounia is thinking of \\nnothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever for the last \\nfew days, and has already made a regular plan for your be -\\ncoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you \\nare a student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, \\nRodya, and share all her plans and hopes, and think there \\nis every probability of realising them. And in spite of Pyotr \\nPetrovitch’s evasiveness, very natural at present (since he \\ndoes not know you), Dounia is firmly persuaded that she \\nwill gain everything by her good influence over her future \\nhusband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are care -\\nful not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr \\nPetrovitch, especially of your becoming his partner. He is a \\npractical man and might take this very coldly, it might all \\nseem to him simply a day-dream. Nor has either Dounia or \\nI breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have of his \\nhelping us to pay for your university studies; we have not \\nspoken of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of \\nitself, later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words \\noffer to do it of himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia \\nthat) the more readily since you may by your own efforts be -\\ncome his right hand in the office, and receive this assistance \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comnot as a charity, but as a salary earned by your own work. \\nDounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree \\nwith her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another \\nreason, that is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on \\nan equal footing when you first meet him. When Dounia \\nspoke to him with enthusiasm about you, he answered that \\none could never judge of a man without seeing him close, \\nfor oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own \\nopinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, \\nmy precious Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons \\n(nothing to do with Pyotr Petrovitch though, simply for my \\nown personal, perhaps old- womanish, fancies) I should do \\nbetter to go on living by myself, apart, than with them, af -\\nter the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous \\nand delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain \\nwith my daughter for the future, and if he has said nothing \\nabout it hitherto, it is simply because it has been taken for \\ngranted; but I shall refuse. I have noticed more than once \\nin my life that husbands don’t quite get on with their moth -\\ners-in- law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s \\nway, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite inde -\\npendent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and \\nsuch children as you and Dounia. If possible, I would set -\\ntle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, \\ndear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, \\nmy dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very \\nshort time and may embrace one another again after a sep -\\naration of almost three years!

And yet all \\nthese questions were not new ones suddenly confronting \\nhim, they were old familiar aches. It was long since they had \\nfirst begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long ago his \\npresent anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and \\ngathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, un -\\ntil it had taken the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic \\nquestion, which tortured his heart and mind, clamouring \\ninsistently for an answer. Now his mother’s letter had burst \\non him like a thunderclap. It was clear that he must not \\nnow suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved ques -\\ntions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it \\nquickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else …\\n‘Or throw up life altogether!’ he cried suddenly, in a fren -\\nzy—‘accept one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle \\neverything in oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life \\nand love!’\\n‘Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means \\nwhen you have absolutely nowhere to turn?’ Marmeladov’s \\nquestion came suddenly into his mind, ‘for every man must \\nhave somewhere to turn….’\\nHe gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had \\nyesterday, slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at \\nthe thought recurring to him, for he knew, he had felt before -\\nhand  that it must come back, he was expecting it; besides it \\nwas not only yesterday’s thought. The difference was that a \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commonth ago, yesterday even, the thought was a mere dream: \\nbut now … now it appeared not a dream at all, it had taken a \\nnew menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly \\nbecame aware of this himself…. He felt a hammering in his \\nhead, and there was a darkness before his eyes.\\nHe looked round hurriedly, he was searching for some -\\nthing. He wanted to sit down and was looking for a seat; he \\nwas walking along the K—— Boulevard. There was a seat \\nabout a hundred paces in front of him. He walked towards \\nit as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little ad -\\nventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the \\nseat, he had noticed a woman walking some twenty paces \\nin front of him, but at first he took no more notice of her \\nthan of other objects that crossed his path. It had happened \\nto him many times going home not to notice the road by \\nwhich he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like \\nthat. But there was at first sight something so strange about \\nthe woman in front of him, that gradually his attention was \\nriveted upon her, at first reluctantly and, as it were, resent -\\nfully, and then more and more intently. He felt a sudden \\ndesire to find out what it was that was so strange about the \\nwoman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl quite \\nyoung, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded \\nand with no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in \\nan absurd way. She had on a dress of some light silky ma -\\nterial, but put on strangely awry, not properly hooked up, \\nand torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the waist: a \\ngreat piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief \\nwas flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18side. The girl was walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and \\nstaggering from side to side. She drew Raskolnikov’s whole \\nattention at last. He overtook the girl at the seat, but, on \\nreaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner; she let \\nher head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes, ap -\\nparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he \\nsaw at once that she was completely drunk. It was a strange \\nand shocking sight. He could hardly believe that he was not \\nmistaken. He saw before him the face of a quite young, fair-\\nhaired girl—sixteen, perhaps not more than fifteen, years \\nold, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking and, as \\nit were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she \\nwas doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it inde -\\ncorously, and showed every sign of being unconscious that \\nshe was in the street.\\nRaskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to \\nleave her, and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard \\nwas never much frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the \\nstifling heat, it was quite deserted. And yet on the further \\nside of the boulevard, about fifteen paces away, a gentleman \\nwas standing on the edge of the pavement. He, too, would \\napparently have liked to approach the girl with some object \\nof his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance \\nand had followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He \\nlooked angrily at him, though he tried to escape his notice, \\nand stood impatiently biding his time, till the unwelcome \\nman in rags should have moved away. His intentions were \\nunmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, \\nabout thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comlips and moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sud -\\nden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way. He left the \\ngirl for a moment and walked towards the gentleman.\\n‘Hey! You Svidrigaïlov!

There is no telling who and what she Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18is, she does not look like a professional. It’s more likely \\nshe has been given drink and deceived somewhere … for \\nthe first time … you understand? and they’ve put her out \\ninto the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, \\nand the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by \\nsomebody, she has not dressed herself, and dressed by un -\\npractised hands, by a man’s hands; that’s evident. And now \\nlook there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I was going \\nto fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen her \\non the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is do -\\ning, and now he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her \\naway somewhere while she is in this state … that’s certain, \\nbelieve me, I am not wrong. I saw him myself watching her \\nand following her, but I prevented him, and he is just wait -\\ning for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and \\nis standing still, pretending to make a cigarette…. Think \\nhow can we keep her out of his hands, and how are we to \\nget her home?’\\nThe policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman \\nwas easy to understand, he turned to consider the girl. The \\npoliceman bent over to examine her more closely, and his \\nface worked with genuine compassion.\\n‘Ah, what a pity!’ he said, shaking his head—‘why, she \\nis quite a child! She has been deceived, you can see that at \\nonce. Listen, lady,’ he began addressing her, ‘where do you \\nlive?’ The girl opened her weary and sleepy-looking eyes, \\ngazed blankly at the speaker and waved her hand.\\n‘Here,’ said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding \\ntwenty copecks, ‘here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comher address. The only thing is to find out her address!’\\n‘Missy, missy!’ the policeman began again, taking the \\nmoney. ‘I’ll fetch you a cab and take you home myself. \\nWhere shall I take you, eh? Where do you live?’\\n‘Go away! They won’t let me alone,’ the girl muttered, and \\nonce more waved her hand.\\n‘Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a \\nshame!’ He shook his head again, shocked, sympathetic and \\nindignant.\\n‘It’s a difficult job,’ the policeman said to Raskolnikov, \\nand as he did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid \\nglance. He, too, must have seemed a strange figure to him: \\ndressed in rags and handing him money!\\n‘Did you meet her far from here?’ he asked him.\\n‘I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just \\nhere, in the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and \\nsank down on it.’\\n‘Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world now -\\nadays, God have mercy on us! An innocent creature like \\nthat, drunk already! She has been deceived, that’s a sure \\nthing. See how her dress has been torn too…. Ah, the vice \\none sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to gen -\\ntlefolk too, poor ones maybe…. There are many like that \\nnowadays. She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,’ \\nand he bent over her once more.\\nPerhaps he had daughters growing up like that, ‘look -\\ning like ladies and refined’ with pretensions to gentility and \\nsmartness….\\n‘The chief thing is,’ Raskolnikov persisted, ‘to keep her Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18out of this scoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! \\nIt’s as clear as day what he is after; ah, the brute, he is not \\nmoving off!’\\nRaskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gen -\\ntleman heard him, and seemed about to fly into a rage again, \\nbut thought better of it, and confined himself to a contemp -\\ntuous look. He then walked slowly another ten paces away \\nand again halted.\\n‘Keep her out of his hands we can,’ said the constable \\nthoughtfully, ‘if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it \\nis…. Missy, hey, missy!’ he bent over her once more.\\nShe opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him \\nintently, as though realising something, got up from the \\nseat and walked away in the direction from which she had \\ncome. ‘Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let me alone!’ she \\nsaid, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though \\nstaggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along an -\\nother avenue, keeping his eye on her.\\n‘Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,’ the police -\\nman said resolutely, and he set off after them.\\n‘Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!’ he repeated aloud, sigh -\\ning.\\nAt that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; \\nin an instant a complete revulsion of feeling came over \\nhim.\\n‘Hey, here!’ he shouted after the policeman.\\nThe latter turned round.\\n‘Let them be!

Raskolnikov laughed.\\n‘Well!’ ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of \\ncontempt, and he walked after the dandy and the girl, prob -\\nably taking Raskolnikov for a madman or something even \\nworse.\\n‘He has carried off my twenty copecks,’ Raskolnikov \\nmurmured angrily when he was left alone. ‘Well, let him \\ntake as much from the other fellow to allow him to have the \\ngirl and so let it end.

Of another one if not that one?\\n‘But where am I going?’ he thought suddenly. ‘Strange, \\nI came out for something. As soon as I had read the letter \\nI came out…. I was going to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Ra -\\nzumihin. That’s what it was … now I remember. What for, \\nthough? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin into \\nmy head just now? That’s curious.’\\nHe wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old \\ncomrades at the university. It was remarkable that Raskol -\\nnikov had hardly any friends at the university; he kept aloof \\nfrom everyone, went to see no one, and did not welcome \\nanyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon \\ngave him up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, \\namusements or conversations. He worked with great inten -\\nsity without sparing himself, and he was respected for this, \\nbut no one liked him. He was very poor, and there was a \\nsort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though he \\nwere keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhis comrades to look down upon them all as children, as \\nthough he were superior in development, knowledge and \\nconvictions, as though their beliefs and interests were be -\\nneath him.\\nWith Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more \\nunreserved and communicative with him. Indeed it was \\nimpossible to be on any other terms with Razumihin. He \\nwas an exceptionally good-humoured and candid youth, \\ngood-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth \\nand dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better \\nof his comrades understood this, and all were fond of him. \\nHe was extremely intelligent, though he was certainly rath -\\ner a simpleton at times. He was of striking appearance—tall, \\nthin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was some -\\ntimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical \\nstrength. One night, when out in a festive company, he had \\nwith one blow laid a gigantic policeman on his back. There \\nwas no limit to his drinking powers, but he could abstain \\nfrom drink altogether; he sometimes went too far in his \\npranks; but he could do without pranks altogether. Another \\nthing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, \\nand it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances \\ncould crush him. He could lodge anywhere, and bear the \\nextremes of cold and hunger. He was very poor, and kept \\nhimself entirely on what he could earn by work of one sort \\nor another. He knew of no end of resources by which to \\nearn money.

Raskolnikov had not \\nbeen to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin \\ndid not even know his address. About two months before, \\nthey had met in the street, but Raskolnikov had turned \\naway and even crossed to the other side that he might not be \\nobserved.

At times monstrous images are created, but the \\nsetting and the whole picture are so truthlike and filled \\nwith details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically \\nconsistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Push -\\nkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in \\nthe waking state. Such sick dreams always remain long in \\nthe memory and make a powerful impression on the over -\\nwrought and deranged nervous system.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back \\nin his childhood in the little town of his birth. He was a \\nchild about seven years old, walking into the country with \\nhis father on the evening of a holiday. It was a grey and \\nheavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it; in -\\ndeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he \\nhad done in memory. The little town stood on a level flat \\nas bare as the hand, not even a willow near it; only in the \\nfar distance, a copse lay, a dark blur on the very edge of the \\nhorizon. A few paces beyond the last market garden stood \\na tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a \\nfeeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with \\nhis father. There was always a crowd there, always shouting, \\nlaughter and abuse, hideous hoarse singing and often fight -\\ning. Drunken and horrible-looking figures were hanging \\nabout the tavern. He used to cling close to his father, trem -\\nbling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road \\nbecame a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. \\nIt was a winding road, and about a hundred paces further \\non, it turned to the right to the graveyard. In the middle \\nof the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola \\nwhere he used to go to mass two or three times a year with \\nhis father and mother, when a service was held in memory \\nof his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom \\nhe had never seen. On these occasions they used to take on \\na white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice \\npudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross. He \\nloved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned ikons and \\nthe old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmoth -\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comer’s grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave \\nof his younger brother who had died at six months old. He \\ndid not remember him at all, but he had been told about \\nhis little brother, and whenever he visited the graveyard he \\nused religiously and reverently to cross himself and to bow \\ndown and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he \\nwas walking with his father past the tavern on the way to \\nthe graveyard; he was holding his father’s hand and looking \\nwith dread at the tavern. A peculiar circumstance attract -\\ned his attention: there seemed to be some kind of festivity \\ngoing on, there were crowds of gaily dressed townspeople, \\npeasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts, all \\nsinging and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the \\ntavern stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those \\nbig carts usually drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with \\ncasks of wine or other heavy goods. He always liked look -\\ning at those great cart- horses, with their long manes, thick \\nlegs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect mountain \\nwith no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going \\nwith a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the \\nshafts of such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of \\nthose peasants’ nags which he had often seen straining their \\nutmost under a heavy load of wood or hay, especially when \\nthe wheels were stuck in the mud or in a rut. And the peas -\\nants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even about the \\nnose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that \\nhe almost cried, and his mother always used to take him \\naway from the window. All of a sudden there was a great \\nuproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came \\nout, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their \\nshoulders.\\n‘Get in, get in!’ shouted one of them, a young thick-\\nnecked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot. ‘I’ll take \\nyou all, get in!’\\nBut at once there was an outbreak of laughter and excla -\\nmations in the crowd.\\n‘Take us all with a beast like that!’\\n‘Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in \\nsuch a cart?’\\n‘And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!’\\n‘Get in, I’ll take you all,’ Mikolka shouted again, leaping \\nfirst into the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up \\nin front. ‘The bay has gone with Matvey,’ he shouted from \\nthe cart—‘and this brute, mates, is just breaking my heart, I \\nfeel as if I could kill her. She’s just eating her head off. Get in, \\nI tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll gallop!’ and he picked \\nup the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little \\nmare.\\n‘Get in! Come along!’ The crowd laughed. ‘D’you hear, \\nshe’ll gallop!’\\n‘Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the \\nlast ten years!’\\n‘She’ll jog along!’\\n‘Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get \\nready!’\\n‘All right! Give it to her!’\\nThey all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commaking jokes. Six men got in and there was still room for \\nmore. They hauled in a fat, rosy-cheeked woman. She was \\ndressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and \\nthick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing. The \\ncrowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could \\nthey help laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the \\ncartload of them at a gallop! Two young fellows in the cart \\nwere just getting whips ready to help Mikolka.

But the six whips were at -\\ntacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised again \\nand fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy \\nmeasured blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not \\nkill her at one blow.\\n‘She’s a tough one,’ was shouted in the crowd.\\n‘She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of \\nher,’ said an admiring spectator in the crowd.\\n‘Fetch an axe to her!

But why, he was \\nalways asking himself, why had such an important, such \\na decisive and at the same time such an absolutely chance \\nmeeting happened in the Hay Market (where he had more -\\nover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of \\nhis life when he was just in the very mood and in the very \\ncircumstances in which that meeting was able to exert the \\ngravest and most decisive influence on his whole destiny? \\nAs though it had been lying in wait for him on purpose!\\nIt was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Mar -\\nket. At the tables and the barrows, at the booths and the \\nshops, all the market people were closing their establish -\\nments or clearing away and packing up their wares and, like \\ntheir customers, were going home. Rag pickers and coster -\\nmongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in \\nthe dirty and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Ras -\\nkolnikov particularly liked this place and the neighbouring \\nalleys, when he wandered aimlessly in the streets. Here his \\nrags did not attract contemptuous attention, and one could \\nwalk about in any attire without scandalising people. At the \\ncorner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables \\nset out with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, \\ntoo, had got up to go home, but were lingering in conver -\\nsation with a friend, who had just come up to them. This \\nfriend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone called her, \\nLizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona \\nIvanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day \\nto pawn his watch and make his experiment …. He already Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18knew all about Lizaveta and she knew him a little too. She \\nwas a single woman of about thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, \\nsubmissive and almost idiotic. She was a complete slave and \\nwent in fear and trembling of her sister, who made her work \\nday and night, and even beat her. She was standing with a \\nbundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly \\nand doubtfully. They were talking of something with spe -\\ncial warmth. The moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, \\nhe was overcome by a strange sensation as it were of intense \\nastonishment, though there was nothing astonishing about \\nthis meeting.\\n‘You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta \\nIvanovna,’ the huckster was saying aloud. ‘Come round to-\\nmorrow about seven. They will be here too.’\\n‘To-morrow?’ said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as \\nthough unable to make up her mind.\\n‘Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Iva -\\nnovna,’ gabbled the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. ‘I \\nlook at you, you are like some little babe. And she is not \\nyour own sister either-nothing but a step-sister and what a \\nhand she keeps over you!’\\n‘But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,’ her \\nhusband interrupted; ‘that’s my advice, but come round to \\nus without asking. It will be worth your while. Later on your \\nsister herself may have a notion.’\\n‘Am I to come?’\\n‘About seven o’clock to-morrow.

And in all this he was always after -\\nwards disposed to see something strange and mysterious, \\nas it were, the presence of some peculiar influences and co -\\nincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew called \\nPokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conver -\\nsation to give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old \\npawnbroker, in case he might want to pawn anything. For \\na long while he did not go to her, for he had lessons and \\nmanaged to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had re -\\nmembered the address; he had two articles that could be \\npawned: his father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwith three red stones, a present from his sister at parting. \\nHe decided to take the ring. When he found the old woman \\nhe had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her at the first \\nglance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got \\ntwo roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern \\non his way home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into \\ndeep thought. A strange idea was pecking at his brain like a \\nchicken in the egg, and very, very much absorbed him.\\nAlmost beside him at the next table there was sitting a \\nstudent, whom he did not know and had never seen, and \\nwith him a young officer. They had played a game of bil -\\nliards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard the \\nstudent mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona \\nIvanovna and give him her address. This of itself seemed \\nstrange to Raskolnikov; he had just come from her and here \\nat once he heard her name. Of course it was a chance, but \\nhe could not shake off a very extraordinary impression, and \\nhere someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him; the \\nstudent began telling his friend various details about Aly -\\nona Ivanovna.\\n‘She is first-rate,’ he said. ‘You can always get money from \\nher. She is as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand \\nroubles at a time and she is not above taking a pledge for a \\nrouble. Lots of our fellows have had dealings with her. But \\nshe is an awful old harpy….’\\nAnd he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she \\nwas, how if you were only a day late with your interest the \\npledge was lost; how she gave a quarter of the value of an ar -\\nticle and took five and even seven percent a month on it and Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18so on. The student chattered on, saying that she had a sister \\nLizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was continually \\nbeating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child, \\nthough Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\\n‘There’s a phenomenon for you,’ cried the student and he \\nlaughed.\\nThey began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke \\nabout her with a peculiar relish and was continually laugh -\\ning and the officer listened with great interest and asked \\nhim to send Lizaveta to do some mending for him. Raskol -\\nnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about \\nher. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her \\nhalf-sister, being the child of a different mother. She was \\nthirty-five. She worked day and night for her sister, and \\nbesides doing the cooking and the washing, she did sew -\\ning and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister all she \\nearned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any \\nkind without her sister’s permission. The old woman had \\nalready made her will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this \\nwill she would not get a farthing; nothing but the movables, \\nchairs and so on; all the money was left to a monastery in \\nthe province of N——, that prayers might be said for her in \\nperpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister, un -\\nmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably \\ntall with long feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. \\nShe always wore battered goatskin shoes, and was clean in \\nher person. What the student expressed most surprise and \\namusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was continu -\\nally with child.\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘But you say she is hideous?’ observed the officer.\\n‘Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier \\ndressed up, but you know she is not at all hideous. She has \\nsuch a good-natured face and eyes. Strikingly so. And the \\nproof of it is that lots of people are attracted by her. She is \\nsuch a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up with anything, \\nalways willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is re -\\nally very sweet.’\\n‘You seem to find her attractive yourself,’ laughed the of -\\nficer.\\n‘From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill \\nthat damned old woman and make off with her money, I as -\\nsure you, without the faintest conscience-prick,’ the student \\nadded with warmth. The officer laughed again while Ras -\\nkolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\\n‘Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,’ the student \\nsaid hotly. ‘I was joking of course, but look here; on one side \\nwe have a stupid, senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, hor -\\nrid old woman, not simply useless but doing actual mischief, \\nwho has not an idea what she is living for herself, and who \\nwill die in a day or two in any case. You understand? You \\nunderstand?’\\n‘Yes, yes, I understand,’ answered the officer, watching \\nhis excited companion attentively.\\n‘Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives \\nthrown away for want of help and by thousands, on every \\nside! A hundred thousand good deeds could be done and \\nhelped, on that old woman’s money which will be buried in \\na monastery!

Let us have another game.’\\nRaskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all \\nordinary youthful talk and thought, such as he had often \\nheard before in different forms and on different themes. But \\nwhy had he happened to hear such a discussion and such \\nideas at the very moment when his own brain was just con -\\nceiving … the very same ideas ? And why, just at the moment \\nwhen he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the \\nold woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation \\nabout her? This coincidence always seemed strange to him. \\nThis trivial talk in a tavern had an immense influence on \\nhim in his later action; as though there had really been in it \\nsomething preordained, some guiding hint….\\n*****\\nOn returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on \\nthe sofa and sat for a whole hour without stirring. Mean -\\nwhile it got dark; he had no candle and, indeed, it did not \\noccur to him to light up. He could never recollect whether \\nhe had been thinking about anything at that time. At last \\nhe was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he \\nrealised with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon \\nheavy, leaden sleep came over him, as it were crushing him.\\nHe slept an extraordinarily long time and without dream -\\ning. Nastasya, coming into his room at ten o’clock the next \\nmorning, had difficulty in rousing him. She brought him in \\ntea and bread. The tea was again the second brew and again \\nin her own tea-pot.\\n‘My goodness, how he sleeps!’ she cried indignantly. ‘And Crime and Punishment 10\\x18he is always asleep.’\\nHe got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, \\ntook a turn in his garret and sank back on the sofa again.\\n‘Going to sleep again,’ cried Nastasya. ‘Are you ill, eh?’\\nHe made no reply.\\n‘Do you want some tea?’\\n‘Afterwards,’ he said with an effort, closing his eyes again \\nand turning to the wall.\\nNastasya stood over him.\\n‘Perhaps he really is ill,’ she said, turned and went out. \\nShe came in again at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as \\nbefore. The tea stood untouched. Nastasya felt positively of -\\nfended and began wrathfully rousing him.\\n‘Why are you lying like a log?’ she shouted, looking at \\nhim with repulsion.\\nHe got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and \\nstared at the floor.\\n‘Are you ill or not?’ asked Nastasya and again received no \\nanswer. ‘You’d better go out and get a breath of air,’ she said \\nafter a pause. ‘Will you eat it or not?’\\n‘Afterwards,’ he said weakly. ‘You can go.’\\nAnd he motioned her out.\\nShe remained a little longer, looked at him with compas -\\nsion and went out.\\nA few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked \\nfor a long while at the tea and the soup. Then he took the \\nbread, took up a spoon and began to eat.\\nHe ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, \\nas it were mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal 10\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhe stretched himself on the sofa again, but now he could not \\nsleep; he lay without stirring, with his face in the pillow. He \\nwas haunted by day-dreams and such strange day-dreams; \\nin one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was in Afri -\\nca, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting, \\nthe camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood \\nall around in a complete circle; all the party were at din -\\nner. But he was drinking water from a spring which flowed \\ngurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was wonderful, \\nwonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-co -\\nloured stones and over the clean sand which glistened here \\nand there like gold…. Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He \\nstarted, roused himself, raised his head, looked out of the \\nwindow, and seeing how late it was, suddenly jumped up \\nwide awake as though someone had pulled him off the sofa. \\nHe crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and be -\\ngan listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But \\nall was quiet on the stairs as if everyone was asleep…. It \\nseemed to him strange and monstrous that he could have \\nslept in such forgetfulness from the previous day and had \\ndone nothing, had prepared nothing yet…. And meanwhile \\nperhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupe -\\nfaction were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it \\nwere distracted haste. But the preparations to be made were \\nfew. He concentrated all his energies on thinking of every -\\nthing and forgetting nothing; and his heart kept beating \\nand thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had \\nto make a noose and sew it into his overcoat—a work of a \\nmoment. He rummaged under his pillow and picked out Crime and Punishment 10\\x18amongst the linen stuffed away under it, a worn out, old \\nunwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long strip, a cou -\\nple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded \\nthis strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat \\nof some stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and \\nbegan sewing the two ends of the rag on the inside, under \\nthe left armhole. His hands shook as he sewed, but he did \\nit successfully so that nothing showed outside when he put \\nthe coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready \\nlong before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As \\nfor the noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the \\nnoose was intended for the axe. It was impossible for him to \\ncarry the axe through the street in his hands. And if hidden \\nunder his coat he would still have had to support it with his \\nhand, which would have been noticeable. Now he had only \\nto put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang \\nquietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his \\ncoat pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, \\nso that it did not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regu -\\nlar sack in fact, it could not be seen from outside that he was \\nholding something with the hand that was in the pocket. \\nThis noose, too, he had designed a fortnight before.\\nWhen he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a \\nlittle opening between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the \\nleft corner and drew out the pledge  which he had got ready \\nlong before and hidden there. This pledge was, however, \\nonly a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and thick -\\nness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of \\nwood in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there 10\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwas some sort of a workshop.

He had \\nonly just got the pledge out when he heard someone sud -\\ndenly about in the yard.\\n‘It struck six long ago.’\\n‘Long ago! My God!’\\nHe rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and \\nbegan to descend his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, \\nlike a cat. He had still the most important thing to do—to \\nsteal the axe from the kitchen. That the deed must be done \\nwith an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a pocket \\npruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still \\nless on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. \\nWe may note in passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the \\nfinal resolutions taken by him in the matter; they had one \\nstrange characteristic: the more final they were, the more \\nhideous and the more absurd they at once became in his \\neyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never Crime and Punishment 10\\x18for a single instant all that time could believe in the carry -\\ning out of his plans.\\nAnd, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything \\nto the least point could have been considered and finally \\nsettled, and no uncertainty of any kind had remained, he \\nwould, it seems, have renounced it all as something absurd, \\nmonstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of unsettled \\npoints and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe, \\nthat trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could \\nbe easier. Nastasya was continually out of the house, espe -\\ncially in the evenings; she would run in to the neighbours or \\nto a shop, and always left the door ajar. It was the one thing \\nthe landlady was always scolding her about. And so, when \\nthe time came, he would only have to go quietly into the \\nkitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when every -\\nthing was over) go in and put it back again. But these were \\ndoubtful points. Supposing he returned an hour later to put \\nit back, and Nastasya had come back and was on the spot. \\nHe would of course have to go by and wait till she went out \\nagain. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss the \\naxe, look for it, make an outcry —that would mean suspi -\\ncion or at least grounds for suspicion.\\nBut those were all trifles which he had not even begun \\nto consider, and indeed he had no time. He was thinking \\nof the chief point, and put off trifling details, until he could \\nbelieve in it all . But that seemed utterly unattainable. So it \\nseemed to himself at least. He could not imagine, for in -\\nstance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get up \\nand simply go there…. Even his late experiment (i.e. his vis -10\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comit with the object of a final survey of the place) was simply \\nan attempt at an experiment, far from being the real thing, \\nas though one should say ‘come, let us go and try it—why \\ndream about it!’—and at once he had broken down and had \\nrun away cursing, in a frenzy with himself. Meanwhile it \\nwould seem, as regards the moral question, that his analy -\\nsis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, \\nand he could not find rational objections in himself. But \\nin the last resort he simply ceased to believe in himself, \\nand doggedly, slavishly sought arguments in all directions, \\nfumbling for them, as though someone were forcing and \\ndrawing him to it.\\nAt first—long before indeed—he had been much occu -\\npied with one question; why almost all crimes are so badly \\nconcealed and so easily detected, and why almost all crimi -\\nnals leave such obvious traces? He had come gradually to \\nmany different and curious conclusions, and in his opinion \\nthe chief reason lay not so much in the material impossi -\\nbility of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. \\nAlmost every criminal is subject to a failure of will and rea -\\nsoning power by a childish and phenomenal heedlessness, \\nat the very instant when prudence and caution are most es -\\nsential. It was his conviction that this eclipse of reason and \\nfailure of will power attacked a man like a disease, devel -\\noped gradually and reached its highest point just before the \\nperpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence \\nat the moment of the crime and for longer or shorter time \\nafter, according to the individual case, and then passed off  \\nlike any other disease. The question whether the disease Crime and Punishment 10\\x18gives rise to the crime, or whether the crime from its own \\npeculiar nature is always accompanied by something of the \\nnature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\\nWhen he reached these conclusions, he decided that in \\nhis own case there could not be such a morbid reaction, that \\nhis reason and will would remain unimpaired at the time of \\ncarrying out his design, for the simple reason that his design \\nwas ‘not a crime….’ We will omit all the process by means of \\nwhich he arrived at this last conclusion; we have run too far \\nahead already…. We may add only that the practical, purely \\nmaterial difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary posi -\\ntion in his mind. ‘One has but to keep all one’s will-power \\nand reason to deal with them, and they will all be overcome \\nat the time when once one has familiarised oneself with the \\nminutest details of the business….’ But this preparation had \\nnever been begun. His final decisions were what he came \\nto trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass \\nquite differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\\nOne trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before \\nhe had even left the staircase. When he reached the land -\\nlady’s kitchen, the door of which was open as usual, he \\nglanced cautiously in to see whether, in Nastasya’s absence, \\nthe landlady herself was there, or if not, whether the door \\nto her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out \\nwhen he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement \\nwhen he suddenly saw that Nastasya was not only at home \\nin the kitchen, but was occupied there, taking linen out of \\na basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing him, she left off  \\nhanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him all the 10\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtime he was passing.

Suddenly he started. From the porter’s room, two \\npaces away from him, something shining under the bench \\nto the right caught his eye…. He looked about him—no -\\nbody. He approached the room on tiptoe, went down two \\nsteps into it and in a faint voice called the porter. ‘Yes, not at \\nhome! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for the door is \\nwide open.’ He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it \\nout from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks \\nof wood; at once, before going out, he made it fast in the \\nnoose, he thrust both hands into his pockets and went out \\nof the room; no one had noticed him! ‘When reason fails, \\nthe devil helps!’ he thought with a strange grin. This chance \\nraised his spirits extraordinarily.\\nHe walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to Crime and Punishment 110avoid awakening suspicion. He scarcely looked at the pass -\\ners-by, tried to escape looking at their faces at all, and to be \\nas little noticeable as possible. Suddenly he thought of his \\nhat. ‘Good heavens! I had the money the day before yester -\\nday and did not get a cap to wear instead!’ A curse rose from \\nthe bottom of his soul.\\nGlancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw \\nby a clock on the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. \\nHe had to make haste and at the same time to go someway \\nround, so as to approach the house from the other side….\\nWhen he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, \\nhe had sometimes thought that he would be very much \\nafraid. But he was not very much afraid now, was not afraid \\nat all, indeed. His mind was even occupied by irrelevant \\nmatters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov \\ngarden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the build -\\ning of great fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the \\natmosphere in all the squares. By degrees he passed to the \\nconviction that if the summer garden were extended to the \\nfield of Mars, and perhaps joined to the garden of the Mi -\\nhailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a great \\nbenefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question \\nwhy in all great towns men are not simply driven by ne -\\ncessity, but in some peculiar way inclined to live in those \\nparts of the town where there are no gardens nor fountains; \\nwhere there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness. \\nThen his own walks through the Hay Market came back to \\nhis mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. ‘What \\nnonsense!’ he thought, ‘better think of nothing at all!’111 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at ev -\\nery object that meets them on the way,’ flashed through his \\nmind, but simply flashed, like lightning; he made haste to \\ndismiss this thought…. And by now he was near; here was \\nthe house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock somewhere \\nstruck once. ‘What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it \\nmust be fast!’\\nLuckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. \\nAt that very moment, as though expressly for his benefit, \\na huge waggon of hay had just driven in at the gate, com -\\npletely screening him as he passed under the gateway, and \\nthe waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into the \\nyard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the \\nother side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quar -\\nrelling; but no one noticed him and no one met him. Many \\nwindows looking into that huge quadrangular yard were \\nopen at that moment, but he did not raise his head—he had \\nnot the strength to. The staircase leading to the old woman’s \\nroom was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was \\nalready on the stairs….\\nDrawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throb -\\nbing heart, and once more feeling for the axe and setting it \\nstraight, he began softly and cautiously ascending the stairs, \\nlistening every minute. But the stairs, too, were quite desert -\\ned; all the doors were shut; he met no one. One flat indeed \\non the first floor was wide open and painters were at work \\nin it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought \\na minute and went on. ‘Of course it would be better if they \\nhad not been here, but … it’s two storeys above them.’Crime and Punishment 11\\x18And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here \\nwas the flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the \\nold woman’s was apparently empty also; the visiting card \\nnailed on the door had been torn off—they had gone away! \\n… He was out of breath. For one instant the thought floated \\nthrough his mind ‘Shall I go back?’ But he made no answer \\nand began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. \\nThen he listened again on the staircase, listened long and \\nintently … then looked about him for the last time, pulled \\nhimself together, drew himself up, and once more tried the \\naxe in the noose. ‘Am I very pale?’ he wondered. ‘Am I not \\nevidently agitated?

On the contrary, as though \\nto spite him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could \\nstand it no longer, he slowly put out his hand to the bell and \\nrang.

She looked \\nintently, maliciously and mistrustfully. A minute passed; he \\neven fancied something like a sneer in her eyes, as though \\nshe had already guessed everything.

How he has \\nwrapped it up!’\\nTrying to untie the string and turning to the window, \\nto the light (all her windows were shut, in spite of the sti -\\nfling heat), she left him altogether for some seconds and \\nstood with her back to him. He unbuttoned his coat and \\nfreed the axe from the noose, but did not yet take it out al -\\ntogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the coat. \\nHis hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment \\ngrowing more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he \\nwould let the axe slip and fall…. A sudden giddiness came \\nover him.\\n‘But what has he tied it up like this for?’ the old woman \\ncried with vexation and moved towards him.\\nHe had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe \\nquite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of \\nhimself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, \\nbrought the blunt side down on her head. He seemed not \\nto use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once \\nbrought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\\nThe old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light \\nhair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was \\nplaited in a rat’s tail and fastened by a broken horn comb \\nwhich stood out on the nape of her neck. As she was so short, \\nthe blow fell on the very top of her skull. She cried out, but 11\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comvery faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, \\nraising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held ‘the \\npledge.’ Then he dealt her another and another blow with \\nthe blunt side and on the same spot. The blood gushed as \\nfrom an overturned glass, the body fell back. He stepped \\nback, let it fall, and at once bent over her face; she was dead. \\nHer eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow \\nand the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\\nHe laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and \\nfelt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming \\nbody)—the same right-hand pocket from which she had \\ntaken the key on his last visit.

But he was unsuccessful. They would \\nnot fit in the locks. It was not so much that his hands were \\nshaking, but that he kept making mistakes; though he saw \\nfor instance that a key was not the right one and would not 11\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered and \\nrealised that the big key with the deep notches, which was \\nhanging there with the small keys could not possibly be -\\nlong to the chest of drawers (on his last visit this had struck \\nhim), but to some strong box, and that everything perhaps \\nwas hidden in that box. He left the chest of drawers, and at \\nonce felt under the bedstead, knowing that old women usu -\\nally keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a \\ngood-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with \\nan arched lid covered with red leather and studded with \\nsteel nails. The notched key fitted at once and unlocked \\nit. At the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red bro -\\ncade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress, then a \\nshawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but \\nclothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood- stained \\nhands on the red brocade. ‘It’s red, and on red blood will be \\nless noticeable,’ the thought passed through his mind; then \\nhe suddenly came to himself. ‘Good God, am I going out of \\nmy senses?’ he thought with terror.\\nBut no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold \\nwatch slipped from under the fur coat. He made haste to \\nturn them all over.

Without any delay, he began \\nfilling up the pockets of his trousers and overcoat without \\nexamining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he had not Crime and Punishment 1\\x180time to take many….\\nHe suddenly heard steps in the room where the old wom -\\nan lay. He stopped short and was still as death. But all was \\nquiet, so it must have been his fancy. All at once he heard \\ndistinctly a faint cry, as though someone had uttered a low \\nbroken moan.

Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran \\nout of the bedroom.\\nIn the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big \\nbundle in her arms. She was gazing in stupefaction at her \\nmurdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have \\nthe strength to cry out. Seeing him run out of the bedroom, \\nshe began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a shudder \\nran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, \\nbut still did not scream. She began slowly backing away \\nfrom him into the corner, staring intently, persistently at \\nhim, but still uttered no sound, as though she could not get \\nbreath to scream. He rushed at her with the axe; her mouth \\ntwitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths, when they \\nbegin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them \\nand are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Liza -\\nveta was so simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and \\nscared that she did not even raise a hand to guard her face, \\nthough that was the most necessary and natural action at \\nthe moment, for the axe was raised over her face. She only \\nput up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly hold -\\ning it out before her as though motioning him away.

I must get away, get \\naway….’\\nHe unfastened the latch, opened the door and began lis -\\ntening on the staircase.\\nHe listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be \\nin the gateway, two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, \\nquarrelling and scolding. ‘What are they about?’ He waited \\npatiently. At last all was still, as though suddenly cut off; \\nthey had separated. He was meaning to go out, but suddenly, \\non the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone \\nbegan going downstairs humming a tune. ‘How is it they all \\nmake such a noise?’ flashed through his mind. Once more \\nhe closed the door and waited. At last all was still, not a soul \\nstirring. He was just taking a step towards the stairs when \\nhe heard fresh footsteps.\\nThe steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the \\nstairs, but he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that \\nfrom the first sound he began for some reason to suspect \\nthat this was someone coming there  to the fourth floor, to \\nthe old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow peculiar, \\nsignificant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now \\nhe had passed the first floor, now he was mounting high -\\ner, it was growing more and more distinct! He could hear \\nhis heavy breathing. And now the third storey had been \\nreached. Coming here! And it seemed to him all at once that \\nhe was turned to stone, that it was like a dream in which \\none is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and \\nis rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\\nAt last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18floor, he suddenly started, and succeeded in slipping neatly \\nand quickly back into the flat and closing the door behind \\nhim. Then he took the hook and softly, noiselessly, fixed it \\nin the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had done this, \\nhe crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown \\nvisitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing \\nopposite one another, as he had just before been standing \\nwith the old woman, when the door divided them and he \\nwas listening.\\nThe visitor panted several times. ‘He must be a big, fat \\nman,’ thought Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. \\nIt seemed like a dream indeed. The visitor took hold of the \\nbell and rang it loudly.\\nAs soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to \\nbe aware of something moving in the room. For some sec -\\nonds he listened quite seriously. The unknown rang again, \\nwaited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at \\nthe handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the \\nhook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected \\nevery minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It cer -\\ntainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it. He \\nwas tempted to hold the fastening, but he might be aware \\nof it. A giddiness came over him again. ‘I shall fall down!’ \\nflashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak \\nand he recovered himself at once.\\n‘What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!’ \\nhe bawled in a thick voice, ‘Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old \\nwitch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! \\nOh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?’1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAnd again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen \\ntimes at the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority \\nand an intimate acquaintance.\\nAt this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, \\non the stairs. someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov \\nhad not heard them at first.\\n‘You don’t say there’s no one at home,’ the new-comer \\ncried in a cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, \\nwho still went on pulling the bell. ‘Good evening, Koch.’\\n‘From his voice he must be quite young,’ thought Ras -\\nkolnikov.\\n‘Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,’ an -\\nswered Koch. ‘But how do you come to know me?\\n‘Why!

The steps died \\naway.\\n‘Good heavens! What am I to do?’\\nRaskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door—\\nthere was no sound. Abruptly, without any thought at all, \\nhe went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he could, and \\nwent downstairs.\\nHe had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard \\na loud voice below—where could he go! There was nowhere \\nto hide. He was just going back to the flat.\\n‘Hey there!

Blast him!’\\nThe shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from \\nthe yard; all was still. But at the same instant several men \\ntalking loud and fast began noisily mounting the stairs. \\nThere were three or four of them. He distinguished the ring -\\ning voice of the young man. ‘They!’\\nFilled with despair he went straight to meet them, feel -\\ning ‘come what must!’ If they stopped him—all was lost; if \\nthey let him pass—all was lost too; they would remember \\nhim. They were approaching; they were only a flight from \\nhim—and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on \\nthe right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, \\nthe flat on the second floor where the painters had been at \\nwork, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just \\nleft. It was they, no doubt, who had just run down, shouting. 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comThe floor had only just been painted, in the middle of the \\nroom stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. \\nIn one instant he had whisked in at the open door and hid -\\nden behind the wall and only in the nick of time; they had \\nalready reached the landing. Then they turned and went on \\nup to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He waited, went out \\non tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\\nNo one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed \\nquickly through the gateway and turned to the left in the \\nstreet.\\nHe knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment \\nthey were at the flat, that they were greatly astonished at \\nfinding it unlocked, as the door had just been fastened, that \\nby now they were looking at the bodies, that before another \\nminute had passed they would guess and completely realise \\nthat the murderer had just been there, and had succeeded \\nin hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They \\nwould guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, \\nwhile they were going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared \\nnot quicken his pace much, though the next turning was \\nstill nearly a hundred yards away. ‘Should he slip through \\nsome gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? \\nNo, hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take \\na cab? Hopeless, hopeless!’\\nAt last he reached the turning. He turned down it more \\ndead than alive. Here he was half way to safety, and he un -\\nderstood it; it was less risky because there was a great crowd \\nof people, and he was lost in it like a grain of sand. But all \\nhe had suffered had so weakened him that he could scarcely Crime and Punishment 1\\x180move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all \\nwet. ‘My word, he has been going it!’ someone shouted at \\nhim when he came out on the canal bank.\\nHe was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the \\nfarther he went the worse it was. He remembered however, \\nthat on coming out on to the canal bank, he was alarmed \\nat finding few people there and so being more conspicuous, \\nand he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost \\nfalling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get \\nhome from quite a different direction.\\nHe was not fully conscious when he passed through the \\ngateway of his house! he was already on the staircase before \\nhe recollected the axe. And yet he had a very grave prob -\\nlem before him, to put it back and to escape observation \\nas far as possible in doing so.

There seemed \\nto be nothing more.\\nSuddenly he remembered that the purse and the things \\nhe had taken out of the old woman’s box were still in his \\npockets! He had not thought till then of taking them out \\nand hiding them! He had not even thought of them while he \\nwas examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed \\nto take them out and fling them on the table. When he had \\npulled out everything, and turned the pocket inside out to \\nbe sure there was nothing left, he carried the whole heap to \\nthe corner. The paper had come off the bottom of the wall \\nand hung there in tatters. He began stuffing all the things \\ninto the hole under the paper: ‘They’re in! All out of sight, \\nand the purse too!’ he thought gleefully, getting up and gaz -1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coming blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. \\nSuddenly he shuddered all over with horror; ‘My God!’ he \\nwhispered in despair: ‘what’s the matter with me? Is that \\nhidden? Is that the way to hide things?’\\nHe had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had \\nonly thought of money, and so had not prepared a hiding-\\nplace.\\n‘But now, now, what am I glad of?’ he thought, ‘Is that \\nhiding things? My reason’s deserting me—simply!’\\nHe sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once \\nshaken by another unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanical -\\nly he drew from a chair beside him his old student’s winter \\ncoat, which was still warm though almost in rags, covered \\nhimself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and \\ndelirium. He lost consciousness.\\nNot more than five minutes had passed when he jumped \\nup a second time, and at once pounced in a frenzy on his \\nclothes again.\\n‘How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, \\nyes; I have not taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, for -\\ngot a thing like that! Such a piece of evidence!’\\nHe pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and \\nthrew the bits among his linen under the pillow.\\n‘Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever \\nhappened; I think not, I think not, any way!’ he repeated, \\nstanding in the middle of the room, and with painful con -\\ncentration he fell to gazing about him again, at the floor and \\neverywhere, trying to make sure he had not forgotten any -\\nthing. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory, Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began \\nto be an insufferable torture.\\n‘Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my pun -\\nishment coming upon me? It is!’\\nThe frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually \\nlying on the floor in the middle of the room, where anyone \\ncoming in would see them!\\n‘What is the matter with me!’ he cried again, like one dis -\\ntraught.\\nThen a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all \\nhis clothes were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there \\nwere a great many stains, but that he did not see them, did \\nnot notice them because his perceptions were failing, were \\ngoing to pieces … his reason was clouded…. Suddenly he \\nremembered that there had been blood on the purse too. \\n‘Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put \\nthe wet purse in my pocket!’\\nIn a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!—\\nthere were traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\\n‘So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have \\nsome sense and memory, since I guessed it of myself,’ he \\nthought triumphantly, with a deep sigh of relief; ‘it’s simply \\nthe weakness of fever, a moment’s delirium,’ and he tore the \\nwhole lining out of the left pocket of his trousers. At that \\ninstant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the sock which \\npoked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He \\nflung off his boots; ‘traces indeed! The tip of the sock was \\nsoaked with blood;’ he must have unwarily stepped into \\nthat pool…. ‘But what am I to do with this now? Where am 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI to put the sock and rags and pocket?’\\nHe gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the \\nmiddle of the room.\\n‘In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of \\nall. Burn them? But what can I burn them with? There are \\nno matches even. No, better go out and throw it all away \\nsomewhere. Yes, better throw it away,’ he repeated, sitting \\ndown on the sofa again, ‘and at once, this minute, without \\nlingering …’\\nBut his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the un -\\nbearable icy shivering came over him; again he drew his \\ncoat over him.\\nAnd for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by \\nthe impulse to ‘go off somewhere at once, this moment, and \\nfling it all away, so that it may be out of sight and done with, \\nat once, at once!’ Several times he tried to rise from the sofa, \\nbut could not.\\nHe was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knock -\\ning at his door.\\n‘Open, do, are you dead or alive?

What have you got there?’\\nHe looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had \\ncut from his trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comSo he had been asleep with them in his hand. Afterwards \\nreflecting upon it, he remembered that half waking up in \\nhis fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand and so \\nfallen asleep again.\\n‘Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as \\nthough he has got hold of a treasure …’\\nAnd Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\\nInstantly he thrust them all under his great coat and \\nfixed his eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being \\ncapable of rational reflection at that moment, he felt that no \\none would behave like that with a person who was going to \\nbe arrested. ‘But … the police?’\\n‘You’d better have some tea!

I’ll bring it, there’s \\nsome left.’\\n‘No … I’m going; I’ll go at once,’ he muttered, getting on \\nto his feet.\\n‘Why, you’ll never get downstairs!’\\n‘Yes, I’ll go.’\\n‘As you please.’\\nShe followed the porter out.\\nAt once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and \\nthe rags.\\n‘There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with \\ndirt, and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had \\nno suspicion could distinguish anything. Nastasya from a \\ndistance could not have noticed, thank God!’ Then with a \\ntremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he \\nwas a long while reading, before he understood. It was an \\nordinary summons from the district police-station to ap -Crime and Punishment 1\\x180pear that day at half-past nine at the office of the district \\nsuperintendent.\\n‘But when has such a thing happened? I never have \\nanything to do with the police!

Shall I put the sock on?’ he suddenly wondered, \\n‘it will get dustier still and the traces will be gone.’\\nBut no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again \\nin loathing and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that \\nhe had no other socks, he picked it up and put it on again—\\nand again he laughed.\\n‘That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way \\nof looking at it,’ he thought in a flash, but only on the top \\nsurface of his mind, while he was shuddering all over, ‘there, \\nI’ve got it on! I have finished by getting it on!’\\nBut his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\\n‘No, it’s too much for me …’ he thought. His legs shook. \\n‘From fear,’ he muttered. His head swam and ached with fe -\\nver. ‘It’s a trick! They want to decoy me there and confound \\nme over everything,’ he mused, as he went out on to the \\nstairs—‘the worst of it is I’m almost light-headed … I may \\nblurt out something stupid …’\\nOn the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the \\nthings just as they were in the hole in the wall, ‘and very \\nlikely, it’s on purpose to search when I’m out,’ he thought, 1\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand stopped short. But he was possessed by such despair, \\nsuch cynicism of misery, if one may so call it, that with a \\nwave of his hand he went on. ‘Only to get it over!’\\nIn the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop \\nof rain had fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and \\nmortar, again the stench from the shops and pot-houses, \\nagain the drunken men, the Finnish pedlars and half-bro -\\nken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes, so that \\nit hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going \\nround—as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out \\ninto the street on a bright sunny day.\\nWhen he reached the turning into the street, in an agony \\nof trepidation he looked down it … at the house … and at \\nonce averted his eyes.\\n‘If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,’ he thought, \\nas he drew near the police-station.\\nThe police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It \\nhad lately been moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a \\nnew house. He had been once for a moment in the old office \\nbut long ago. Turning in at the gateway, he saw on the right \\na flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with a book \\nin his hand. ‘A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is \\nhere,’ and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He \\ndid not want to ask questions of anyone.\\n‘I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything …’ he \\nthought, as he reached the fourth floor.\\nThe staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty \\nwater. The kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and \\nstood open almost the whole day. So there was a fearful Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18smell and heat. The staircase was crowded with porters \\ngoing up and down with their books under their arms, po -\\nlicemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door \\nof the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood wait -\\ning within. There, too, the heat was stifling and there was \\na sickening smell of fresh paint and stale oil from the newly \\ndecorated rooms.\\nAfter waiting a little, he decided to move forward into \\nthe next room. All the rooms were small and low-pitched. \\nA fearful impatience drew him on and on. No one paid at -\\ntention to him.

Yet the head clerk great -\\nly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him and \\nguess something from his face.\\nHe was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a \\ndark mobile face that looked older than his years. He was \\nfashionably dressed and foppish, with his hair parted in the \\nmiddle, well combed and pomaded, and wore a number of \\nrings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain on his \\nwaistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner \\nwho was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\\n‘Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,’ he said casually to the \\ngaily- dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair \\nbeside her.\\n‘Ich danke,’ said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk \\nshe sank into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with \\nwhite lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and \\nfilled almost half the room. She smelt of scent. But she was \\nobviously embarrassed at filling half the room and smelling \\nso strongly of scent; and though her smile was impudent as \\nwell as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\\nThe lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All \\nat once, with some noise, an officer walked in very jaun -\\ntily, with a peculiar swing of his shoulders at each step. He \\ntossed his cockaded cap on the table and sat down in an \\neasy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her seat \\non seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; \\nbut the officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she \\ndid not venture to sit down again in his presence. He was \\nthe assistant superintendent. He had a reddish moustache \\nthat stood out horizontally on each side of his face, and ex -\\ntremely small features, expressive of nothing much except a \\ncertain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignant -\\nly at Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite \\nof his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in \\nkeeping with his clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a \\nvery long and direct look on him, so that he felt positively \\naffronted.\\n‘What do you want?’ he shouted, apparently astonished \\nthat such a ragged fellow was not annihilated by the maj -\\nesty of his glance.1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘I was summoned … by a notice …’ Raskolnikov fal -\\ntered.\\n‘For the recovery of money due, from the student  ’ the \\nhead clerk interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his \\npapers. ‘Here!’ and he flung Raskolnikov a document and \\npointed out the place. ‘Read that!’\\n‘Money? What money?’ thought Raskolnikov, ‘but … \\nthen … it’s certainly not that. ’\\nAnd he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense inde -\\nscribable relief. A load was lifted from his back.\\n‘And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?’ \\nshouted the assistant superintendent, seeming for some un -\\nknown reason more and more aggrieved. ‘You are told to \\ncome at nine, and now it’s twelve!’\\n‘The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour \\nago,’ Raskolnikov answered loudly over his shoulder. To his \\nown surprise he, too, grew suddenly angry and found a cer -\\ntain pleasure in it. ‘And it’s enough that I have come here ill \\nwith fever.’\\n‘Kindly refrain from shouting!’\\n‘I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who \\nare shouting at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout \\nat me.’\\nThe assistant superintendent was so furious that for the \\nfirst minute he could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped \\nup from his seat.\\n‘Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be im -\\npudent, sir!’\\n‘You’re in a government office, too,’ cried Raskolnikov, Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18‘and you’re smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you \\nare showing disrespect to all of us.’\\nHe felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\\nThe head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry as -\\nsistant superintendent was obviously disconcerted.\\n‘That’s not your business!’ he shouted at last with un -\\nnatural loudness. ‘Kindly make the declaration demanded \\nof you. Show him. Alexandr Grigorievitch. There is a com -\\nplaint against you! You don’t pay your debts! You’re a fine \\nbird!’\\nBut Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly \\nclutched at the paper, in haste to find an explanation. He \\nread it once, and a second time, and still did not under -\\nstand.\\n‘What is this?’ he asked the head clerk.\\n‘It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You \\nmust either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give \\na written declaration when you can pay it, and at the same \\ntime an undertaking not to leave the capital without pay -\\nment, and nor to sell or conceal your property.

Was that worth \\nworrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, \\nhe read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions \\nhimself, but all mechanically. The triumphant sense of se -\\ncurity, of deliverance from overwhelming danger, that was \\nwhat filled his whole soul that moment without thought for \\nthe future, without analysis, without suppositions or sur -\\nmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an \\ninstant of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very \\nmoment something like a thunderstorm took place in the \\noffice. The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskol -\\nnikov’s disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to \\nkeep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate \\nsmart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came \\nin with an exceedingly silly smile.\\n‘You shameful hussy!’ he shouted suddenly at the top of \\nhis voice. (The lady in mourning had left the office.) ‘What \\nwas going on at your house last night? Eh! A disgrace again, \\nyou’re a scandal to the whole street.

The assistant superintendent, still shaken by Raskol -\\nnikov’s disrespect, still fuming and obviously anxious to \\nkeep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the unfortunate \\nsmart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came \\nin with an exceedingly silly smile.\\n‘You shameful hussy!’ he shouted suddenly at the top of \\nhis voice. (The lady in mourning had left the office.) ‘What \\nwas going on at your house last night? Eh! A disgrace again, \\nyou’re a scandal to the whole street. Fighting and drinking \\nagain. Do you want the house of correction? Why, I have \\nwarned you ten times over that I would not let you off the \\neleventh! And here you are again, again, you … you … !’\\nThe paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18wildly at the smart lady who was so unceremoniously treat -\\ned. But he soon saw what it meant, and at once began to find \\npositive amusement in the scandal. He listened with plea -\\nsure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh … all his nerves \\nwere on edge.\\n‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk was beginning anxiously, \\nbut stopped short, for he knew from experience that the en -\\nraged assistant could not be stopped except by force.\\nAs for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled be -\\nfore the storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and \\nviolent the terms of abuse became, the more amiable she \\nlooked, and the more seductive the smiles she lavished on \\nthe terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and curtsied in -\\ncessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her \\nword: and at last she found it.\\n‘There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. \\nCaptain,’ she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speak -\\ning Russian confidently, though with a strong German \\naccent, ‘and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, \\nand it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain, and I am \\nnot to blame…. Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain, \\nand honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, al -\\nways dislike any scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, \\nand asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one \\nleg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and \\nthat is not at all right in an honourable house, and he ganz  \\nbroke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I \\nsaid so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone \\nwith it. And then I called the porter, and Karl came, and he 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtook Karl and hit him in the eye; and he hit Henriette in the \\neye, too, and gave me five slaps on the cheek. And it was so \\nungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and I \\nscreamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and \\nstood in the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a dis -\\ngrace. The idea of squealing like a little pig at the window \\ninto the street! Fie upon him! And Karl pulled him away \\nfrom the window by his coat, and it is true, Mr. Captain, he \\ntore sein rock . And then he shouted that man muss  pay him \\nfifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, \\nfive roubles for sein rock . And he is an ungentlemanly visi -\\ntor and caused all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, \\n‘for I can write to all the papers about you.’’\\n‘Then he was an author?’\\n‘Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in \\nan honourable house….’\\n‘Now then! Enough! I have told you already …’\\n‘Ilya Petrovitch!’ the head clerk repeated significantly.\\nThe assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk \\nslightly shook his head.\\n‘… So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, \\nand I tell it you for the last time,’ the assistant went on. ‘If \\nthere is a scandal in your honourable house once again, I \\nwill put you yourself in the lock-up, as it is called in polite \\nsociety. Do you hear? So a literary man, an author took five \\nroubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable house’? A nice set, \\nthese authors!’\\nAnd he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. \\n‘There was a scandal the other day in a restaurant, too. An Crime and Punishment 1\\x180author had eaten his dinner and would not pay; ‘I’ll write \\na satire on you,’ says he. And there was another of them \\non a steamer last week used the most disgraceful language \\nto the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and \\ndaughter. And there was one of them turned out of a con -\\nfectioner’s shop the other day. They are like that, authors, \\nliterary men, students, town-criers…. Pfoo! You get along! I \\nshall look in upon you myself one day. Then you had better \\nbe careful! Do you hear?’\\nWith hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying \\nin all directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at \\nthe door, she stumbled backwards against a good-looking \\nofficer with a fresh, open face and splendid thick fair whis -\\nkers. This was the superintendent of the district himself, \\nNikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste to curtsy \\nalmost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she \\nfluttered out of the office.\\n‘Again thunder and lightning—a hurricane!’ said \\nNikodim Fomitch to Ilya Petrovitch in a civil and friendly \\ntone. ‘You are aroused again, you are fuming again!

It is for me to explain … how \\nit all happened … In my turn … though I agree with you \\n… it is unnecessary. But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. \\nI remained lodging there as before, and when my landlady \\nmoved into her present quarters, she said to me … and in a \\nfriendly way … that she had complete trust in me, but still, \\nwould I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen \\nroubles, all the debt I owed her.

What am I to say to that?’\\n‘All these affecting details are no business of ours.’ Ilya \\nPetrovitch interrupted rudely. ‘You must give a written un -\\ndertaking but as for your love affairs and all these tragic \\nevents, we have nothing to do with that.’\\n‘Come now … you are harsh,’ muttered Nikodim Fomi -\\ntch, sitting down at the table and also beginning to write. \\nHe looked a little ashamed.\\n‘Write!’ said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\\n‘Write what?’ the latter asked, gruffly.\\n‘I will dictate to you.’\\nRaskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more \\ncasually and contemptuously after his speech, but strange \\nto say he suddenly felt completely indifferent to anyone’s \\nopinion, and this revulsion took place in a flash, in one in -\\nstant. If he had cared to think a little, he would have been \\namazed indeed that he could have talked to them like that \\na minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where \\nhad those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had \\nbeen filled, not with police officers, but with those nearest \\nand dearest to him, he would not have found one human \\nword for them, so empty was his heart. A gloomy sensa -\\ntion of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took \\nconscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his \\nsentimental effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the mean -\\nness of the latter’s triumph over him that had caused this \\nsudden revulsion in his heart. Oh, what had he to do now \\nwith his own baseness, with all these petty vanities, offi -\\ncers, German women, debts, police- offices? If he had been Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have \\nstirred, would hardly have heard the sentence to the end. \\nSomething was happening to him entirely new, sudden and \\nunknown. It was not that he understood, but he felt clearly \\nwith all the intensity of sensation that he could never more \\nappeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental \\neffusions like his recent outburst, or with anything what -\\never; and that if they had been his own brothers and sisters \\nand not police-officers, it would have been utterly out of the \\nquestion to appeal to them in any circumstance of life. He \\nhad never experienced such a strange and awful sensation. \\nAnd what was most agonising—it was more a sensation than \\na conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising \\nof all the sensations he had known in his life.\\nThe head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of \\ndeclaration, that he could not pay, that he undertook to do \\nso at a future date, that he would not leave the town, nor sell \\nhis property, and so on.\\n‘But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,’ ob -\\nserved the head clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. \\n‘Are you ill?’\\n‘Yes, I am giddy. Go on!’\\n‘That’s all. Sign it.’\\nThe head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to \\nothers.\\nRaskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up \\nand going away, he put his elbows on the table and pressed \\nhis head in his hands. He felt as if a nail were being driven \\ninto his skull. A strange idea suddenly occurred to him, to 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comget up at once, to go up to Nikodim Fomitch, and tell him \\neverything that had happened yesterday, and then to go \\nwith him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the \\nhole in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up \\nfrom his seat to carry it out. ‘Hadn’t I better think a minute?’ \\nflashed through his mind. ‘No, better cast off the burden \\nwithout thinking.’ But all at once he stood still, rooted to \\nthe spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly with Ilya \\nPetrovitch, and the words reached him:\\n‘It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, \\nthe whole story contradicts itself.

What if I \\nfind them in my room?’\\nBut here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one \\nhad peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heav -\\nens! how could he have left all those things in the hole?\\nHe rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the pa -\\nper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. \\nThere were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings \\nor something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four \\nsmall leather cases.

He put them all in the different pockets \\nof his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, \\ntrying to conceal them as much as possible. He took the \\npurse, too. Then he went out of his room, leaving the door \\nopen. He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt \\nshattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of \\npursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another \\nquarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued \\nfor his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces \\nbefore then. He must clear everything up while he still had \\nsome strength, some reasoning power left him….

Not seeing anyone in the yard, \\nhe slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as \\nis often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-\\ndrivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in \\nchalk the time-honoured witticism, ‘Standing here strictly \\nforbidden.’ This was all the better, for there would be noth -\\ning suspicious about his going in. ‘Here I could throw it all \\nin a heap and get away!’\\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his \\npocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the en -\\ntrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps 1\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsixty pounds.

But he was not destined to go there. \\nFor coming out of V—— Prospect towards the square, he \\nsaw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to \\na courtyard. On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed \\nwall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on \\nthe left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twen -\\nty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. \\nHere was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of dif -\\nferent sorts was lying. At the end of the court, the corner of \\na low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some work -\\nshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It was probably a \\ncarriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place from \\nthe entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the \\nplace to throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, \\nhe slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as \\nis often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-\\ndrivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in \\nchalk the time-honoured witticism, ‘Standing here strictly \\nforbidden.’ This was all the better, for there would be noth -\\ning suspicious about his going in. ‘Here I could throw it all \\nin a heap and get away!’\\nLooking round once more, with his hand already in his \\npocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the en -\\ntrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps 1\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He \\ncould hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but \\nhe could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone \\ncame in from the street, which might well happen indeed, \\nso there was need of haste.\\nHe bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in \\nboth hands, and using all his strength turned it over. Under \\nthe stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immedi -\\nately emptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the top, and \\nyet the hollow was not filled up. Then he seized the stone \\nagain and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the \\nsame position again, though it stood a very little higher. But \\nhe scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with \\nhis foot. Nothing could be noticed.\\nThen he went out, and turned into the square. Again an \\nintense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an in -\\nstant, as it had in the police-office. ‘I have buried my tracks! \\nAnd who, who can think of looking under that stone? It has \\nbeen lying there most likely ever since the house was built, \\nand will lie as many years more. And if it were found, who \\nwould think of me? It is all over! No clue!’ And he laughed. \\nYes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous \\nnoiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was \\ncrossing the square. But when he reached the K—— Bou -\\nlevard where two days before he had come upon that girl, \\nhis laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his \\nmind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass \\nthat seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and \\npondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty co -\\npecks: ‘Damn him!’\\nHe walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. \\nAll his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single \\npoint, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that \\nnow, now, he was left facing that point—and for the first \\ntime, indeed, during the last two months.\\n‘Damn it all!’ he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovern -\\nable fury. ‘If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new \\nlife! Good Lord, how stupid it is! … And what lies I told \\nto-day! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya \\nPetrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all, \\nand my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It is not \\nthat at all!’\\nSuddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and \\nexceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly con -\\nfounded him.\\n‘If it all has really been done deliberately and not idioti -\\ncally, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it \\nI did not even glance into the purse and don’t know what I \\nhad there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and \\nhave deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading \\nbusiness? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water \\nthe purse together with all the things which I had not seen \\neither … how’s that?’\\nYes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all \\nbefore, and it was not a new question for him, even when \\nit was decided in the night without hesitation and con -\\nsideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.compossibly be otherwise…. Yes, he had known it all, and un -\\nderstood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday \\nat the moment when he was bending over the box and pull -\\ning the jewel-cases out of it…. Yes, so it was.\\n‘It is because I am very ill,’ he decided grimly at last, ‘I \\nhave been worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know \\nwhat I am doing…. Yesterday and the day before yesterday \\nand all this time I have been worrying myself…. I shall get \\nwell and I shall not worry…. But what if I don’t get well at \\nall? Good God, how sick I am of it all!’\\nHe walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing \\nfor some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what \\nto attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining \\nmore and more mastery over him every moment; this was \\nan immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything \\nsurrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred. \\nAll who met him were loathsome to him—he loathed their \\nfaces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had ad -\\ndressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten \\nhim….\\nHe stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the \\nLittle Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. ‘Why, \\nhe lives here, in that house,’ he thought, ‘why, I have not \\ncome to Razumihin of my own accord! Here it’s the same \\nthing over again….

As \\nyou like for all I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I \\ndon’t care about that, but there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov—\\nand he takes the place of a lesson. I would not exchange him \\nfor five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a kind, and issuing \\nnatural science manuals and what a circulation they have! \\nThe very titles are worth the money! You always maintained \\nthat I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools \\nthan I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that \\nhe has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage \\nhim. Here are two signatures of the German text—in my \\nopinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, \\n‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly \\nproves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this \\nwork as a contribution to the woman question; I am trans -\\nlating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long \\nand bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six \\nroubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles \\nfor the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we \\nhave finished this, we are going to begin a translation about \\nwhales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the sec -\\nond part of Les Confessions  we have marked for translation; \\nsomebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of \\nRadishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang \\nhim! Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘ Is \\nwoman a human being? ’ If you would, take the German and \\npens and paper—all those are provided, and take three rou -\\nbles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole \\nthing, three roubles come to you for your share. And when \\nyou have finished the signature there will be another three \\nroubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a \\nservice; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw \\nhow you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spell -\\ning, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, \\nso that I make it up as I go along for the most part. The \\nonly comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better. \\nThough who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. \\nWill you take it?’\\nRaskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took \\nthe three roubles and without a word went out. Razumihin \\ngazed after him in astonishment. But when Raskolnikov \\nwas in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs \\nto Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German \\narticle and the three roubles, went out again, still without 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comuttering a word.\\n‘Are you raving, or what?’ Razumihin shouted, roused to \\nfury at last. ‘What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too … \\nwhat did you come to see me for, damn you?’\\n‘I don’t want … translation,’ muttered Raskolnikov from \\nthe stairs.\\n‘Then what the devil do you want?’ shouted Razumihin \\nfrom above. Raskolnikov continued descending the stair -\\ncase in silence.\\n‘Hey, there! Where are you living?’\\nNo answer.\\n‘Well, confound you then!’\\nBut Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On \\nthe Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness \\nagain by an unpleasant incident. A coachman, after shout -\\ning at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on \\nthe back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his \\nhorses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed \\naway to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been \\nwalking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic). He \\nangrily clenched and ground his teeth. He heard laughter, \\nof course.\\n‘Serves him right!’\\n‘A pickpocket I dare say.’\\n‘Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the \\nwheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him.’\\n‘It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.’\\nBut while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and \\nbewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand. \\nHe looked. It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goat -\\nskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter wearing a hat, \\nand carrying a green parasol.\\n‘Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.’\\nHe took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty \\ncopecks. From his dress and appearance they might well \\nhave taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and \\nthe gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, \\nwhich made them feel sorry for him.\\nHe closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for \\nten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the \\npalace. The sky was without a cloud and the water was al -\\nmost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva. The cupola of \\nthe cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about \\ntwenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and \\nin the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distin -\\nguished. The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov \\nforgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occu -\\npied him now completely. He stood still, and gazed long and \\nintently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar \\nto him. When he was attending the university, he had hun -\\ndreds of times—generally on his way home—stood still on \\nthis spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and al -\\nmost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion \\nit roused in him. It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous \\npicture was for him blank and lifeless.

He vividly 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrecalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to \\nhim that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. \\nIt struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have \\nstopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually \\nimagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested \\nin the same theories and pictures that had interested him \\n… so short a time ago.

But Crime and Punishment 1\\x180the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. \\nAnd then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of \\nhis landlady. She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rap -\\nidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out \\nwhat she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, \\nnot to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on \\nthe stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from \\nspite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was \\nsaying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hur -\\nrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he \\nrecognised the voice—it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya \\nPetrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her, \\nbanging her head against the steps—that’s clear, that can \\nbe told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How \\nis it, is the world topsy-turvy? He could hear people run -\\nning in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he \\nheard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging. ‘But \\nwhy, why, and how could it be?’ he repeated, thinking seri -\\nously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! \\nAnd they would come to him then next, ‘for no doubt … it’s \\nall about that … about yesterday…. Good God!’ He would \\nhave fastened his door with the latch, but he could not lift  \\nhis hand … besides, it would be useless. Terror gripped his \\nheart like ice, tortured him and numbed him…. But at last \\nall this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began \\ngradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groan -\\ning; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses…. \\nBut at last he, too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not \\nbe heard. ‘Can he have gone away? Good Lord!’ Yes, and 1\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comnow the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning \\n… and then her door slammed…. Now the crowd was go -\\ning from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, \\ncalling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, drop -\\nping them to a whisper. There must have been numbers of \\nthem—almost all the inmates of the block. ‘But, good God, \\nhow could it be! And why, why had he come here!’\\nRaskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not \\nclose his eyes. He lay for half an hour in such anguish, such \\nan intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never \\nexperienced before. Suddenly a bright light flashed into his \\nroom. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. \\nLooking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not \\nasleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out \\nwhat she had brought—bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\\n‘You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve \\nbeen trudging about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.’\\n‘Nastasya … what were they beating the landlady for?’\\nShe looked intently at him.\\n‘Who beat the landlady?’\\n‘Just now … half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assis -\\ntant superintendent, on the stairs…. Why was he ill-treating \\nher like that, and … why was he here?’\\nNastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her \\nscrutiny lasted a long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened \\nat her searching eyes.\\n‘Nastasya, why don’t you speak?’ he said timidly at last \\nin a weak voice.\\n‘It’s the blood,’ she answered at last softly, as though Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18speaking to herself.\\n‘Blood? What blood?’ he muttered, growing white and \\nturning towards the wall.\\nNastasya still looked at him without speaking.\\n‘Nobody has been beating the landlady,’ she declared at \\nlast in a firm, resolute voice.\\nHe gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\\n‘I heard it myself…. I was not asleep … I was sitting up,’ \\nhe said still more timidly. ‘I listened a long while. The as -\\nsistant superintendent came…. Everyone ran out on to the \\nstairs from all the flats.’\\n‘No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your \\nears. When there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you \\nbegin fancying things…. Will you eat something?’\\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, \\nwatching him.\\n‘Give me something to drink … Nastasya.’\\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthen -\\nware jug of water. He remembered only swallowing one sip \\nof the cold water and spilling some on his neck. Then fol -\\nlowed forgetfulness.1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter III\\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the \\ntime he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes \\ndelirious, sometimes half conscious. He remembered a great \\ndeal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though there were \\na number of people round him; they wanted to take him \\naway somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and \\ndiscussing about him. Then he would be alone in the room; \\nthey had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and \\nthen opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened \\nhim, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at \\nhim. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he dis -\\ntinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know \\nvery well, though he could not remember who he was, and \\nthis fretted him, even made him cry. Sometimes he fancied \\nhe had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed \\npart of the same day. But of that—of that he had no recol -\\nlection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten \\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and torment -\\ned himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, \\nor sank into awful, intolerable terror. Then he struggled to \\nget up, would have run away, but someone always prevented \\nhim by force, and he sank back into impotence and forget -\\nfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\\nIt happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak \\nof light on the right wall and the corner near the door. \\nNastasya was standing beside him with another person, a \\ncomplete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisi -\\ntively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, \\nshort- waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The land -\\nlady was peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov \\nsat up.\\n‘Who is this, Nastasya?’ he asked, pointing to the young \\nman.\\n‘I say, he’s himself again!’ she said.\\n‘He is himself,’ echoed the man.\\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the land -\\nlady closed the door and disappeared.

When there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you \\nbegin fancying things…. Will you eat something?’\\nHe made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, \\nwatching him.\\n‘Give me something to drink … Nastasya.’\\nShe went downstairs and returned with a white earthen -\\nware jug of water. He remembered only swallowing one sip \\nof the cold water and spilling some on his neck. Then fol -\\nlowed forgetfulness.1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter III\\nHe was not completely unconscious, however, all the \\ntime he was ill; he was in a feverish state, sometimes \\ndelirious, sometimes half conscious. He remembered a great \\ndeal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though there were \\na number of people round him; they wanted to take him \\naway somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and \\ndiscussing about him. Then he would be alone in the room; \\nthey had all gone away afraid of him, and only now and \\nthen opened the door a crack to look at him; they threatened \\nhim, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked at \\nhim. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he dis -\\ntinguished another person, too, whom he seemed to know \\nvery well, though he could not remember who he was, and \\nthis fretted him, even made him cry. Sometimes he fancied \\nhe had been lying there a month; at other times it all seemed \\npart of the same day. But of that—of that he had no recol -\\nlection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten \\nsomething he ought to remember. He worried and torment -\\ned himself trying to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, \\nor sank into awful, intolerable terror. Then he struggled to \\nget up, would have run away, but someone always prevented \\nhim by force, and he sank back into impotence and forget -\\nfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\\nIt happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18the sun shone into the room at that hour, throwing a streak \\nof light on the right wall and the corner near the door. \\nNastasya was standing beside him with another person, a \\ncomplete stranger, who was looking at him very inquisi -\\ntively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full, \\nshort- waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The land -\\nlady was peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov \\nsat up.\\n‘Who is this, Nastasya?’ he asked, pointing to the young \\nman.\\n‘I say, he’s himself again!’ she said.\\n‘He is himself,’ echoed the man.\\nConcluding that he had returned to his senses, the land -\\nlady closed the door and disappeared. She was always shy \\nand dreaded conversations or discussions. She was a wom -\\nan of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black \\neyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, \\nand absurdly bashful.\\n‘Who … are you?’ he went on, addressing the man. But at \\nthat moment the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, \\nas he was so tall, Razumihin came in.\\n‘What a cabin it is!’ he cried. ‘I am always knocking my \\nhead. You call this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? \\nI’ve just heard the news from Pashenka.’\\n‘He has just come to,’ said Nastasya.\\n‘Just come to,’ echoed the man again, with a smile.\\n‘And who are you?’ Razumihin asked, suddenly ad -\\ndressing him. ‘My name is Vrazumihin, at your service; \\nnot Razumihin, as I am always called, but Vrazumihin, a 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comstudent and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are \\nyou?’\\n‘I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant \\nShelopaev, and I’ve come on business.’\\n‘Please sit down.’ Razumihin seated himself on the other \\nside of the table. ‘It’s a good thing you’ve come to, broth -\\ner,’ he went on to Raskolnikov. ‘For the last four days you \\nhave scarcely eaten or drunk anything. We had to give you \\ntea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see you twice. You \\nremember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said \\nat once it was nothing serious—something seemed to have \\ngone to your head. Some nervous nonsense, the result of \\nbad feeding, he says you have not had enough beer and rad -\\nish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you will be all \\nright. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a \\nname. Come, I won’t keep you,’ he said, addressing the man \\nagain. ‘Will you explain what you want? You must know, \\nRodya, this is the second time they have sent from the office; \\nbut it was another man last time, and I talked to him. Who \\nwas it came before?’\\n‘That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you \\nplease, sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our of -\\nfice, too.’\\n‘He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?’\\n‘Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.’\\n‘Quite so; go on.’\\n‘At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch \\nVahrushin, of whom I presume you have heard more than \\nonce, a remittance is sent to you from our office,’ the man Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18began, addressing Raskolnikov. ‘If you are in an intelli -\\ngible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as \\nSemyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivano -\\nvitch at your mamma’s request instructions to that effect, as \\non previous occasions. Do you know him, sir?’\\n‘Yes, I remember … Vahrushin,’ Raskolnikov said dream -\\nily.\\n‘You hear, he knows Vahrushin,’ cried Razumihin. ‘He \\nis in ‘an intelligible condition’! And I see you are an intel -\\nligent man too. Well, it’s always pleasant to hear words of \\nwisdom.’\\n‘That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. \\nAnd at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a \\nremittance once before in the same manner through him, \\nhe did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to \\nSemyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-\\nfive roubles in the hope of better to come.’\\n‘That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve \\nsaid, though ‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, \\nwhat do you say? Is he fully conscious, eh?’\\n‘That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.’\\n‘He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?’\\n‘Yes, here’s the book.’\\n‘Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the \\npen and scribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, broth -\\ner, money is sweeter to us than treacle.’\\n‘I don’t want it,’ said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\\n‘Not want it?’\\n‘I won’t sign it.’1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘How the devil can you do without signing it?’\\n‘I don’t want … the money.’\\n‘Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, \\nI bear witness. Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on \\nhis travels again. But that’s pretty common with him at all \\ntimes though…. You are a man of judgment and we will \\ntake him in hand, that is, more simply, take his hand and he \\nwill sign it. Here.’\\n‘But I can come another time.’\\n‘No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of \\njudgment…. Now, Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see \\nhe is waiting,’ and he made ready to hold Raskolnikov’s \\nhand in earnest.\\n‘Stop, I’ll do it alone,’ said the latter, taking the pen and \\nsigning his name.\\nThe messenger took out the money and went away.\\n‘Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?’\\n‘Yes,’ answered Raskolnikov.\\n‘Is there any soup?’\\n‘Some of yesterday’s,’ answered Nastasya, who was still \\nstanding there.\\n‘With potatoes and rice in it?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘I know it by heart.

But from some queer, almost animal, \\ncunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and \\nlying low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet \\nin full possession of his faculties, and meanwhile listening \\nto find out what was going on. Yet he could not overcome \\nhis sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen spoonfuls of \\ntea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away \\ncapriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actu -\\nally real pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean \\ncases, he observed that, too, and took note of it.\\n‘Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to Crime and Punishment 1\\x180make him some raspberry tea,’ said Razumihin, going back \\nto his chair and attacking his soup and beer again.\\n‘And where is she to get raspberries for you?’ asked Nas -\\ntasya, balancing a saucer on her five outspread fingers and \\nsipping tea through a lump of sugar.\\n‘She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts \\nof things have been happening while you have been laid up. \\nWhen you decamped in that rascally way without leaving \\nyour address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out \\nand punish you. I set to work that very day. How I ran about \\nmaking inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had for -\\ngotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I \\ndid not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only \\nremember it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I \\nkept trying to find that Harlamov’s house, and afterwards \\nit turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but Buch’s. How \\none muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and \\nI went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and \\nonly fancy, in two minutes they looked you up! Your name \\nis down there.’\\n‘My name!’\\n‘I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could \\nnot find while I was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon \\nas I did land on this place, I soon got to know all your af -\\nfairs—all, all, brother, I know everything; Nastasya here \\nwill tell you. I made the acquaintance of Nikodim Fomitch \\nand Ilya Petrovitch, and the house- porter and Mr. Zame -\\ntov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police \\noffice, and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here 1\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comknows….’\\n‘He’s got round her,’ Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\\n‘Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Ni -\\nkiforovna?’\\n‘You are a one!’ Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a \\ngiggle. ‘I am not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,’ she added sud -\\ndenly, recovering from her mirth.\\n‘I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story \\nshort, I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot \\nall malignant influences in the locality, but Pashenka won \\nthe day. I had not expected, brother, to find her so … pre -\\npossessing. Eh, what do you think?’\\nRaskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed \\nupon him, full of alarm.\\n‘And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,’ \\nRazumihin went on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\\n‘Ah, the sly dog!’ Nastasya shrieked again. This conversa -\\ntion afforded her unspeakable delight.\\n‘It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the \\nright way at first. You ought to have approached her differ -\\nently. She is, so to speak, a most unaccountable character. \\nBut we will talk about her character later…. How could \\nyou let things come to such a pass that she gave up send -\\ning you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been \\nmad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when \\nher daughter, Natalya Yegorovna, was alive? … I know all \\nabout it! But I see that’s a delicate matter and I am an ass; \\nforgive me. But, talking of foolishness, do you know Pras -\\nkovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as you would think Crime and Punishment 1\\x18\\x18at first sight?’\\n‘No,’ mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling \\nthat it was better to keep up the conversation.\\n‘She isn’t, is she?’ cried Razumihin, delighted to get an \\nanswer out of him. ‘But she is not very clever either, eh? She \\nis essentially, essentially an unaccountable character! I am \\nsometimes quite at a loss, I assure you…. She must be forty; \\nshe says she is thirty- six, and of course she has every right \\nto say so.

And another thing that was of special \\ninterest to you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me \\nmy sock.’ Zametov hunted all about your room for your \\nsocks, and with his own scented, ring-bedecked fingers he 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comgave you the rag.

Look here, my dear boy.’1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHe began untying the bundle, which evidently interested \\nhim.\\n‘Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my \\nheart. For we must make a man of you. Let’s begin from the \\ntop.

Just right!’ he cried triumphantly, fitting it \\non, ‘just your size! A proper head-covering is the first thing \\nin dress and a recommendation in its own way. Tolstyakov, \\na friend of mine, is always obliged to take off his pudding \\nbasin when he goes into any public place where other peo -\\nple wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from \\nslavish politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of \\nhis bird’s nest; he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, \\nhere are two specimens of headgear: this Palmerston’—he \\ntook from the corner Raskolnikov’s old, battered hat, which \\nfor some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston—‘or this \\njewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid \\nfor it, Nastasya!’ he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskol -\\nnikov did not speak.\\n‘Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,’ answered Nasta -\\nsya.\\n‘Twenty copecks, silly!’ he cried, offended. ‘Why, nowa -\\ndays you would cost more than that—eighty copecks! And Crime and Punishment 1\\x180that only because it has been worn. And it’s bought on con -\\ndition that when’s it’s worn out, they will give you another \\nnext year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to the \\nUnited States of America, as they called them at school. I \\nassure you I am proud of these breeches,’ and he exhibit -\\ned to Raskolnikov a pair of light, summer trousers of grey \\nwoollen material. ‘No holes, no spots, and quite respectable, \\nalthough a little worn; and a waistcoat to match, quite in \\nthe fashion. And its being worn really is an improvement, \\nit’s softer, smoother…. You see, Rodya, to my thinking, the \\ngreat thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to \\nthe seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in Janu -\\nary, you keep your money in your purse; and it’s the same \\nwith this purchase. It’s summer now, so I’ve been buying \\nsummer things— warmer materials will be wanted for au -\\ntumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case … \\nespecially as they will be done for by then from their own \\nlack of coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. \\nCome, price them! What do you say? Two roubles twen -\\nty-five copecks! And remember the condition: if you wear \\nthese out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only \\ndo business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a \\nthing once, you are satisfied for life, for you will never go \\nthere again of your own free will. Now for the boots. What \\ndo you say? You see that they are a bit worn, but they’ll last \\na couple of months, for it’s foreign work and foreign leather; \\nthe secretary of the English Embassy sold them last week—\\nhe had only worn them six days, but he was very short of \\ncash.

Just look!’ and he pulled out of his pocket Raskol -\\nnikov’s old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. ‘I did \\nnot go empty- handed—they took the size from this mon -\\nster.

A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop fac -\\ning the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s case \\ncontaining some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. \\n‘The day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’—mark the \\nday and the hour!—‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, \\nwho had been in to see me already that day, brought me \\nthis box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give 1\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhim two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got \\nthem, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not \\nask him anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. \\n‘I gave him a note’—a rouble that is—‘for I thought if he \\ndid not pawn it with me he would with another. It would \\nall come to the same thing—he’d spend it on drink, so the \\nthing had better be with me. The further you hide it the \\nquicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear \\nany rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all \\ntaradiddle; he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, \\nhe is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he \\ndid not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in or -\\nder to give it to the police. He was simply afraid. But no \\nmatter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known this peas -\\nant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the \\nsame province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan \\nmen. And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and \\nI knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmi -\\ntri, who comes from the same village, too. As soon as he \\ngot the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took \\nhis change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him \\nthen. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered \\nAlyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with \\nan axe. I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-\\nrings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money \\non pledges. I went to the house, and began to make care -\\nful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all \\nI asked, ‘Is Nikolay here?’ Dmitri told me that Nikolay had \\ngone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, Crime and Punishment \\x1800stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. \\nDmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the job alone. \\nAnd their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the \\nsecond floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word \\nto anyone’—that’s Dushkin’s tale—‘but I found out what I \\ncould about the murder, and went home feeling as suspi -\\ncious as ever. And at eight o’clock this morning’— that was \\nthe third day, you understand—‘I saw Nikolay coming in, \\nnot sober, though not to say very drunk—he could under -\\nstand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and \\ndid not speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a \\nman I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. ‘Have you \\nseen Dmitri?’ said I. ‘No, I haven’t,’ said he. ‘And you’ve not \\nbeen here either?’ ‘Not since the day before yesterday,’ said \\nhe. ‘And where did you sleep last night?’ ‘In Peski, with the \\nKolomensky men.’ ‘And where did you get those ear-rings?’ \\nI asked. ‘I found them in the street,’ and the way he said it \\nwas a bit queer; he did not look at me. ‘Did you hear what \\nhappened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same \\nstaircase?’ said I. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I had not heard,’ and all the \\nwhile he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head \\nand he turned as white as chalk. I told him all about it and \\nhe took his hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him. \\n‘Wait a bit, Nikolay,’ said I, ‘won’t you have a drink?’ And I \\nsigned to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from be -\\nhind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the \\nturning at a run. I have not seen him since. Then my doubts \\nwere at an end—it was his doing, as clear as could be….’’\\n‘I should think so,’ said Zossimov.\\x1801 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Wait! Hear the end.

And then Dmitri escaped and \\nran into the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch \\nhim, and went back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my \\nthings. I began putting them together, expecting Dmitri to \\ncome, and there in the passage, in the corner by the door, I \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comstepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper. \\nI took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them, and \\nin the box were the ear-rings….’’\\n‘Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the \\ndoor?’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly, staring with a blank \\nlook of terror at Razumihin, and he slowly sat up on the \\nsofa, leaning on his hand.\\n‘Yes … why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?’ Razumi -\\nhin, too, got up from his seat.\\n‘Nothing,’ Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the \\nwall. All were silent for a while.\\n‘He must have waked from a dream,’ Razumihin said \\nat last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly \\nshook his head.\\n‘Well, go on,’ said Zossimov. ‘What next?’\\n‘What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting \\nDmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to Du -\\nshkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him. He told a \\nlie saying he found them in the street, and went off drink -\\ning. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder: ‘I \\nknow nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yes -\\nterday.’ ‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ \\n‘I was frightened.’ ‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ \\n‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’ ‘That I should be accused of \\nit.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now what do you sup -\\npose they deduced from that?’\\n‘Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a \\nfact. You wouldn’t have your painter set free?’\\n‘Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18haven’t a shadow of doubt.’\\n‘That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the \\near-rings? You must admit that, if on the very same day \\nand hour ear-rings from the old woman’s box have come \\ninto Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there somehow. \\nThat’s a good deal in such a case.’\\n‘How did they get there? How did they get there?’ cried \\nRazumihin. ‘How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to \\nstudy man and who has more opportunity than anyone else \\nfor studying human nature—how can you fail to see the \\ncharacter of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at \\nonce that the answers he has given in the examination are \\nthe holy truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has \\ntold us—he stepped on the box and picked it up.’\\n‘The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a \\nlie at first?’\\n‘Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and \\nPestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first \\nporter and the woman who was sitting in the porter’s lodge \\nand the man Kryukov, who had just got out of a cab at that \\nminute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm, that \\nis eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on \\nthe ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri \\nhung on to his hair, beating him, too.

He \\nbegan by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him \\nwith offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though \\nasking himself what sort of place he had come to. Mistrust -\\nfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost \\naffronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow ‘cabin.’ \\nWith the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who \\nlay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable \\ndirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with the same de -\\nliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and \\nunshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and \\ninquiringly in the face without rising from his seat. A con -\\nstrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as \\nmight be expected, some scene-shifting took place. Reflect -\\ning, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that \\nhe would get nothing in this ‘cabin’ by attempting to over -\\nawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, \\nthough with some severity, emphasising every syllable of \\nhis question, addressed Zossimov:\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or former -\\nly a student?’\\nZossimov made a slight movement, and would have an -\\nswered, had not Razumihin anticipated him.\\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Here he is lying on the sofa!

He was \\nturning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and \\nturned to Zossimov again.\\n‘This is Raskolnikov,’ mumbled Zossimov, nodding to -\\nwards him. Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his \\nmouth as wide as possible. Then he lazily put his hand into \\nhis waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a \\nround hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly \\nand lazily proceeded to put it back.\\nRaskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, \\ngazing persistently, though without understanding, at \\nthe stranger.

But the \\nnew-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then \\nhis wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossi -\\nmov said ‘This is Raskolnikov’ he jumped up quickly, sat on \\nthe sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, \\nvoice articulated:\\n‘Yes, I am Raskolnikov!

I am a comrade of \\nRodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am nurs -\\ning him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with \\x1811 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comyour business.’\\n‘Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my \\npresence and conversation?’ Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zos -\\nsimov.\\n‘N-no,’ mumbled Zossimov; ‘you may amuse him.’ He \\nyawned again.\\n‘He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,’ \\nwent on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much \\nlike unaffected good- nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to \\nbe more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and \\nimpudent person had introduced himself as a student.\\n‘Your mamma,’ began Luzhin.\\n‘Hm!’ Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin \\nlooked at him inquiringly.\\n‘That’s all right, go on.’\\nLuzhin shrugged his shoulders.\\n‘Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I \\nwas sojourning in her neighbourhood. On my arrival here \\nI purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to \\nsee you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were \\nin full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonish -\\nment …’\\n‘I know, I know!’ Raskolnikov cried suddenly with im -\\npatient vexation. ‘So you are the fiancé ? I know, and that’s \\nenough!’\\nThere was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being of -\\nfended this time, but he said nothing. He made a violent \\neffort to understand what it all meant. There was a mo -\\nment’s silence.Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards \\nhim when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again \\nwith marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look \\nat him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he \\nrose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him. There cer -\\ntainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole \\nappearance, something which seemed to justify the title of \\n‘fiancé’ so unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, \\nit was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petro -\\nvitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to \\nget himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his be -\\ntrothed—a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, \\nindeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, conscious -\\nness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might \\nhave been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr \\nPetrovitch had taken up the rôle of fiancé. All his clothes \\nwere fresh from the tailor’s and were all right, except for be -\\ning too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the stylish \\nnew round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch \\ntreated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his \\nhands. The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, \\ntold the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing \\nthem, but carrying them in his hand for show. Light and \\nyouthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch’s attire. \\nHe wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light \\nthin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a \\ncravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and \\nthe best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very \\nfresh and even handsome face looked younger than his for -\\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comty-five years at all times. His dark, mutton-chop whiskers \\nmade an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly \\nupon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched \\nhere and there with grey, though it had been combed and \\ncurled at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appear -\\nance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting \\na German on his wedding-day. If there really was some -\\nthing unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking \\nand imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes. \\nAfter scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov \\nsmiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at \\nthe ceiling as before.\\nBut Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to deter -\\nmine to take no notice of their oddities.\\n‘I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,’ \\nhe began, again breaking the silence with an effort. ‘If I had \\nbeen aware of your illness I should have come earlier. But \\nyou know what business is. I have, too, a very important \\nlegal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupa -\\ntions which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your \\nmamma and sister any minute.’\\nRaskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to \\nspeak; his face showed some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch \\npaused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on:\\n‘… Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their \\narrival.’\\n‘Where?’ asked Raskolnikov weakly.\\n‘Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.’\\n‘That’s in Voskresensky,’ put in Razumihin. ‘There are Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve \\nbeen there.’\\n‘Yes, rooms …’\\n‘A disgusting place—filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of \\ndoubtful character. Things have happened there, and there \\nare all sorts of queer people living there. And I went there \\nabout a scandalous business. It’s cheap, though …’\\n‘I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am \\na stranger in Petersburg myself,’ Pyotr Petrovitch replied \\nhuffily. ‘However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, \\nand as it is for so short a time … I have already taken a \\npermanent, that is, our future flat,’ he said, addressing Ras -\\nkolnikov, ‘and I am having it done up.

Hitherto, for instance, if I were \\ntold, ‘love thy neighbour,’ what came of it?’ Pyotr Petrovitch \\nwent on, perhaps with excessive haste. ‘It came to my tear -\\ning my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both \\nwere left half naked. As a Russian proverb has it, ‘Catch sev -\\neral hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells us, \\nlove yourself before all men, for everything in the world \\nrests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your \\nown affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Econom -\\nic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in \\nsociety—the more whole coats, so to say—the firmer are its \\nfoundations and the better is the common welfare organised \\ntoo. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for \\nmyself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combring to pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a \\ntorn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but \\nas a consequence of the general advance. The idea is simple, \\nbut unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being \\nhindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it would \\nseem to want very little wit to perceive it …’\\n‘Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,’ Razumihin cut in \\nsharply, ‘and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with \\nan object, but I’ve grown so sick during the last three years \\nof this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow \\nof commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush \\neven when other people talk like that. You are in a hurry, no \\ndoubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you, \\nthat’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort \\nof man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got \\nhold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in \\ntheir own interests everything they touched, that the whole \\ncause has been dragged in the mire. That’s enough!’\\n‘Excuse me, sir,’ said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking \\nwith excessive dignity. ‘Do you mean to suggest so uncer -\\nemoniously that I too …’\\n‘Oh, my dear sir … how could I? … Come, that’s enough,’ \\nRazumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov \\nto continue their previous conversation.\\nPyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the dis -\\navowal. He made up his mind to take leave in another \\nminute or two.\\n‘I trust our acquaintance,’ he said, addressing Raskolnikov, \\n‘may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18of which you are aware, become closer … Above all, I hope \\nfor your return to health …’\\nRaskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petro -\\nvitch began getting up from his chair.\\n‘One of her customers must have killed her,’ Zossimov \\ndeclared positively.\\n‘Not a doubt of it,’ replied Razumihin. ‘Porfiry doesn’t \\ngive his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges \\nwith her there.’\\n‘Examining them?’ Raskolnikov asked aloud.\\n‘Yes. What then?’\\n‘Nothing.’\\n‘How does he get hold of them?’ asked Zossimov.\\n‘Koch has given the names of some of them, other names \\nare on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come for -\\nward of themselves.’\\n‘It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The \\nboldness of it! The coolness!’\\n‘That’s just what it wasn’t!’ interposed Razumihin. ‘That’s \\nwhat throws you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is \\nnot cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first \\ncrime! The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a \\ncunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose him to have been \\ninexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance that \\nsaved him—and chance may do anything. Why, he did not \\nforesee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work?

Strange \\nto say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly \\ncalm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic \\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment \\nof a strange sudden calm. His movements were precise and \\ndefinite; a firm purpose was evident in them. ‘To-day, to-\\nday,’ he muttered to himself. He understood that he was \\nstill weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him \\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he \\nwould not fall down in the street. When he had dressed in \\nentirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the ta -\\nble, and after a moment’s thought put it in his pocket. It was \\ntwenty-five roubles. He took also all the copper change from \\nthe ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes. Then he \\nsoftly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and \\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing \\nwith her back to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. \\nShe heard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his going \\nout, indeed? A minute later he was in the street.\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as \\nstifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty \\ntown air.

He did not know and did not think where \\nhe was going, he had one thought only: ‘that all this must be \\nended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not \\nreturn home without it, because he would not go on living \\nlike that . ’ How, with what to make an end? He had not an \\nidea about it, he did not even want to think of it. He drove \\naway thought; thought tortured him.

Leave me.’\\nHe turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18Chapter VI\\nBut as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, \\nundid the parcel which Razumihin had brought in that \\nevening and had tied up again and began dressing. Strange \\nto say, he seemed immediately to have become perfectly \\ncalm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic \\nfear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment \\nof a strange sudden calm. His movements were precise and \\ndefinite; a firm purpose was evident in them. ‘To-day, to-\\nday,’ he muttered to himself. He understood that he was \\nstill weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him \\nstrength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he \\nwould not fall down in the street. When he had dressed in \\nentirely new clothes, he looked at the money lying on the ta -\\nble, and after a moment’s thought put it in his pocket. It was \\ntwenty-five roubles. He took also all the copper change from \\nthe ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes. Then he \\nsoftly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and \\nglanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing \\nwith her back to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. \\nShe heard nothing. Who would have dreamed of his going \\nout, indeed? A minute later he was in the street.\\nIt was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as \\nstifling as before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty \\ntown air. His head felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comgleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale \\nand yellow face. He did not know and did not think where \\nhe was going, he had one thought only: ‘that all this must be \\nended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would not \\nreturn home without it, because he would not go on living \\nlike that . ’ How, with what to make an end? He had not an \\nidea about it, he did not even want to think of it. He drove \\naway thought; thought tortured him. All he knew, all he felt \\nwas that everything must be changed ‘one way or another,’ \\nhe repeated with desperate and immovable self-confidence \\nand determination.\\nFrom old habit he took his usual walk in the direction \\nof the Hay Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel \\norgan was standing in the road in front of a little general \\nshop and was grinding out a very sentimental song. He was \\naccompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood on the pavement \\nin front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a man -\\ntle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all \\nvery old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, \\ncracked and coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope \\nof getting a copper from the shop. Raskolnikov joined two \\nor three listeners, took out a five copeck piece and put it in \\nthe girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a sentimental high \\nnote, shouted sharply to the organ grinder ‘Come on,’ and \\nboth moved on to the next shop.\\n‘Do you like street music?’ said Raskolnikov, addressing \\na middle-aged man standing idly by him. The man looked \\nat him, startled and wondering.\\n‘I love to hear singing to a street organ,’ said Raskolnikov, Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18and his manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the \\nsubject—‘I like it on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings—\\nthey must be damp—when all the passers-by have pale \\ngreen, sickly faces, or better still when wet snow is falling \\nstraight down, when there’s no wind—you know what I \\nmean?—and the street lamps shine through it …’\\n‘I don’t know…. Excuse me …’ muttered the stranger, \\nfrightened by the question and Raskolnikov’s strange man -\\nner, and he crossed over to the other side of the street.\\nRaskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the cor -\\nner of the Hay Market, where the huckster and his wife had \\ntalked with Lizaveta; but they were not there now. Recog -\\nnising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a \\nyoung fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn \\nchandler’s shop.\\n‘Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this \\ncorner?’\\n‘All sorts of people keep booths here,’ answered the young \\nman, glancing superciliously at Raskolnikov.\\n‘What’s his name?’\\n‘What he was christened.’\\n‘Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?’\\nThe young man looked at Raskolnikov again.\\n‘It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Gra -\\nciously forgive me, your excellency!’\\n‘Is that a tavern at the top there?’\\n‘Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and \\nyou’ll find princesses there too…. La-la!’\\nRaskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coma dense crowd of peasants. He pushed his way into the thick -\\nest part of it, looking at the faces. He felt an unaccountable \\ninclination to enter into conversation with people. But the \\npeasants took no notice of him; they were all shouting in \\ngroups together. He stood and thought a little and took a \\nturning to the right in the direction of V.\\nHe had often crossed that little street which turns at an \\nangle, leading from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of \\nlate he had often felt drawn to wander about this district, \\nwhen he felt depressed, that he might feel more so.\\nNow he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point \\nthere is a great block of buildings, entirely let out in dram \\nshops and eating- houses; women were continually running \\nin and out, bare-headed and in their indoor clothes. Here \\nand there they gathered in groups, on the pavement, espe -\\ncially about the entrances to various festive establishments \\nin the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds \\nof singing, the tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, \\nfloated into the street. A crowd of women were throng -\\ning round the door; some were sitting on the steps, others \\non the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunk -\\nen soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in \\nthe road, swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way \\nsomewhere, but had forgotten where. One beggar was quar -\\nrelling with another, and a man dead drunk was lying right \\nacross the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of women, \\nwho were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed \\nand wore cotton dresses and goatskin shoes.

Raskolnikov felt a \\ngreat desire to make out what he was singing, as though ev -\\nerything depended on that.\\n‘Shall I go in?’ he thought. ‘They are laughing. From \\ndrink. Shall I get drunk?’\\n‘Won’t you come in?’ one of the women asked him. Her \\nvoice was still musical and less thick than the others, she \\nwas young and not repulsive—the only one of the group.\\n‘Why, she’s pretty,’ he said, drawing himself up and look -\\ning at her.\\nShe smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\\n‘You’re very nice looking yourself,’ she said.\\n‘Isn’t he thin though!’ observed another woman in a deep \\nbass. ‘Have you just come out of a hospital?’\\n‘They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have \\nall snub noses,’ interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile \\non his face, wearing a loose coat. ‘See how jolly they are.’\\n‘Go along with you!’\\n‘I’ll go, sweetie!’\\nAnd he darted down into the saloon below.

Have you the papers?’ \\nhe asked, going into a very spacious and positively clean \\nrestaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were, how -\\never, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, \\nand in a room further away were sitting four men drinking \\nchampagne.

Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table. \\nHe looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just \\nthe same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, \\nwith the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsmart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He \\nwas in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and \\ngood-humouredly. His dark face was rather flushed from \\nthe champagne he had drunk.\\n‘What, you here?’ he began in surprise, speaking as \\nthough he’d known him all his life. ‘Why, Razumihin told \\nme only yesterday you were unconscious. How strange! \\nAnd do you know I’ve been to see you?’\\nRaskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid \\naside the papers and turned to Zametov. There was a smile \\non his lips, and a new shade of irritable impatience was ap -\\nparent in that smile.\\n‘I know you have,’ he answered. ‘I’ve heard it. You looked \\nfor my sock…. And you know Razumihin has lost his heart \\nto you?

What are you doing, reading the papers?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘There’s a lot about the fires.’\\n‘No, I am not reading about the fires.’ Here he looked \\nmysteriously at Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a \\nmocking smile. ‘No, I am not reading about the fires,’ he \\nwent on, winking at Zametov. ‘But confess now, my dear \\nfellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading \\nabout?’\\n‘I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do \\nyou keep on … ?’\\n‘Listen, you are a man of culture and education?’\\n‘I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,’ said Zametov \\nwith some dignity.\\n‘Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow!

At the same moment his face resumed its original \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\\n‘There have been a great many of these crimes lately,’ said \\nZametov. ‘Only the other day I read in the Moscow News  \\nthat a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Mos -\\ncow. It was a regular society. They used to forge tickets!’\\n‘Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month \\nago,’ Raskolnikov answered calmly. ‘So you consider them \\ncriminals?’ he added, smiling.\\n‘Of course they are criminals.’\\n‘They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, \\nhalf a hundred people meeting for such an object—what an \\nidea! Three would be too many, and then they want to have \\nmore faith in one another than in themselves! One has only \\nto blab in his cups and it all collapses. Simpletons! They en -\\ngaged untrustworthy people to change the notes— what a \\nthing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that \\nthese simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and \\nwhat follows for the rest of their lives? Each is dependent \\non the others for the rest of his life! Better hang oneself at \\nonce! And they did not know how to change the notes ei -\\nther; the man who changed the notes took five thousand \\nroubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four \\nthousand, but did not count the fifth thousand—he was in \\nsuch a hurry to get the money into his pocket and run away. \\nOf course he roused suspicion. And the whole thing came \\nto a crash through one fool! Is it possible?’\\n‘That his hands trembled?’ observed Zametov, ‘yes, that’s \\nquite possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes \\none can’t stand things.’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘Can’t stand that?’\\n‘Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the \\nsake of a hundred roubles to face such a terrible experience? \\nTo go with false notes into a bank where it’s their business \\nto spot that sort of thing! No, I should not have the face to \\ndo it. Would you?’\\nRaskolnikov had an intense desire again ‘to put his \\ntongue out.’ Shivers kept running down his spine.\\n‘I should do it quite differently,’ Raskolnikov began. ‘This \\nis how I would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand \\nthree or four times backwards and forwards, looking at ev -\\nery note and then I’d set to the second thousand; I’d count \\nthat half-way through and then hold some fifty-rouble note \\nto the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light again—to \\nsee whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, \\n‘a relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day \\nthrough a false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole sto -\\nry. And after I began counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I \\nwould say, ‘I fancy I made a mistake in the seventh hundred \\nin that second thousand, I am not sure.’ And so I would give \\nup the third thousand and go back to the second and so on \\nto the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from \\nthe fifth and one from the second thousand and take them \\nagain to the light and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and \\nput the clerk into such a stew that he would not know how \\nto get rid of me. When I’d finished and had gone out, I’d \\ncome back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation. \\nThat’s how I’d do it.’\\n‘Foo! what terrible things you say!’ said Zametov, laugh -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coming. ‘But all that is only talk. I dare say when it came to \\ndeeds you’d make a slip. I believe that even a practised, des -\\nperate man cannot always reckon on himself, much less \\nyou and I. To take an example near home—that old woman \\nmurdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been \\na desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, \\nwas saved by a miracle—but his hands shook, too. He did \\nnot succeed in robbing the place, he couldn’t stand it. That \\nwas clear from the …’\\nRaskolnikov seemed offended.\\n‘Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?’ he cried, mali -\\nciously gibing at Zametov.\\n‘Well, they will catch him.’\\n‘Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve \\na tough job! A great point for you is whether a man is spend -\\ning money or not. If he had no money and suddenly begins \\nspending, he must be the man. So that any child can mis -\\nlead you.’\\n‘The fact is they always do that, though,’ answered Zame -\\ntov. ‘A man will commit a clever murder at the risk of his \\nlife and then at once he goes drinking in a tavern. They are \\ncaught spending money, they are not all as cunning as you \\nare. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?’\\nRaskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\\n‘You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know \\nhow I should behave in that case, too?’ he asked with dis -\\npleasure.\\n‘I should like to,’ Zametov answered firmly and serious -\\nly. Somewhat too much earnestness began to appear in his Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18words and looks.\\n‘Very much?’\\n‘Very much!’\\n‘All right then.

See what a lot \\nof money!’ he held out his shaking hand to Zametov with \\nnotes in it. ‘Red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles. Where \\ndid I get them? And where did my new clothes come from? \\nYou know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my \\nlandlady, I’ll be bound…. Well, that’s enough! Assez causé!  \\nTill we meet again!’\\nHe went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180hysterical sensation, in which there was an element of in -\\nsufferable rapture. Yet he was gloomy and terribly tired. His \\nface was twisted as after a fit. His fatigue increased rapidly. \\nAny shock, any irritating sensation stimulated and revived \\nhis energies at once, but his strength failed as quickly when \\nthe stimulus was removed.\\nZametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, \\nplunged in thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a \\nrevolution in his brain on a certain point and had made up \\nhis mind for him conclusively.\\n‘Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,’ he decided.\\nRaskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restau -\\nrant when he stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. \\nThey did not see each other till they almost knocked against \\neach other. For a moment they stood looking each other up \\nand down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then anger, \\nreal anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\\n‘So here you are!’ he shouted at the top of his voice—‘you \\nran away from your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you \\nunder the sofa! We went up to the garret. I almost beat Nas -\\ntasya on your account. And here he is after all. Rodya! What \\nis the meaning of it? Tell me the whole truth! Confess! Do \\nyou hear?’\\n‘It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be \\nalone,’ Raskolnikov answered calmly.\\n‘Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face \\nis as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot! \\n… What have you been doing in the Palais de Cristal? Own \\nup at once!’\\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Let me go!’ said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This \\nwas too much for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the \\nshoulder.\\n‘Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know \\nwhat I’ll do with you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in \\na bundle, carry you home under my arm and lock you up!’\\n‘Listen, Razumihin,’ Raskolnikov began quietly, ap -\\nparently calm— ‘can’t you see that I don’t want your \\nbenevolence? A strange desire you have to shower benefits \\non a man who … curses them, who feels them a burden \\nin fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my \\nillness? Maybe I was very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plain -\\nly enough to-day that you were torturing me, that I was … \\nsick of you! You seem to want to torture people! I assure \\nyou that all that is seriously hindering my recovery, because \\nit’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov went away \\njust now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for \\ngoodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me \\nby force? Don’t you see that I am in possession of all my \\nfaculties now? How, how can I persuade you not to perse -\\ncute me with your kindness? I may be ungrateful, I may be \\nmean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be! Let me be, \\nlet me be!’\\nHe began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venom -\\nous phrases he was about to utter, but finished, panting for \\nbreath, in a frenzy, as he had been with Luzhin.\\nRazumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand \\ndrop.\\n‘Well, go to hell then,’ he said gently and thoughtfully.

With a curse he returned \\nwith rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zame -\\ntov.\\nRaskolnikov walked straight to X—— Bridge, stood in Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into \\nthe distance. On parting with Razumihin, he felt so much \\nweaker that he could scarcely reach this place. He longed to \\nsit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending over the \\nwater, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the \\nsunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering \\ntwilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flash -\\ning as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at \\nthe darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to \\ncatch his attention. At last red circles flashed before his eyes, \\nthe houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, \\nthe carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he start -\\ned, saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and \\nhideous sight. He became aware of someone standing on \\nthe right side of him; he looked and saw a tall woman with \\na kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and \\nred sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but obvi -\\nously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she \\nleaned her right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg \\nover the railing, then her left and threw herself into the ca -\\nnal. The filthy water parted and swallowed up its victim for \\na moment, but an instant later the drowning woman float -\\ned to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head \\nand legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over \\nher back.\\n‘A woman drowning! A woman drowning!’ shouted doz -\\nens of voices; people ran up, both banks were thronged \\nwith spectators, on the bridge people crowded about Ras -\\nkolnikov, pressing up behind him.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!’ a woman cried tearfully \\nclose by. ‘Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!’\\n‘A boat, a boat’ was shouted in the crowd. But there was \\nno need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the ca -\\nnal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into \\nthe water. It was easy to reach her: she floated within a cou -\\nple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes \\nwith his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a \\ncomrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled \\nout at once. They laid her on the granite pavement of the \\nembankment. She soon recovered consciousness, raised \\nher head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly \\nwiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\\n‘She’s drunk herself out of her senses,’ the same woman’s \\nvoice wailed at her side. ‘Out of her senses. The other day \\nshe tried to hang herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the \\nshop just now, left my little girl to look after her—and here \\nshe’s in trouble again! A neighbour, gentleman, a neighbour, \\nwe live close by, the second house from the end, see yon -\\nder….’\\nThe crowd broke up. The police still remained round the \\nwoman, someone mentioned the police station…. Raskol -\\nnikov looked on with a strange sensation of indifference and \\napathy. He felt disgusted. ‘No, that’s loathsome … water … \\nit’s not good enough,’ he muttered to himself. ‘Nothing will \\ncome of it,’ he added, ‘no use to wait. What about the police \\noffice … ? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The \\npolice office is open till ten o’clock….’ He turned his back to \\nthe railing and looked about him.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘Very well then!’ he said resolutely; he moved from the \\nbridge and walked in the direction of the police office. His \\nheart felt hollow and empty. He did not want to think. Even \\nhis depression had passed, there was not a trace now of the \\nenergy with which he had set out ‘to make an end of it all.’ \\nComplete apathy had succeeded to it.\\n‘Well, it’s a way out of it,’ he thought, walking slowly and \\nlistlessly along the canal bank. ‘Anyway I’ll make an end, \\nfor I want to…. But is it a way out? What does it matter! \\nThere’ll be the square yard of space—ha! But what an end! \\nIs it really the end? Shall I tell them or not? Ah … damn! \\nHow tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie down \\nsoon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But \\nI don’t care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into \\none’s head.’\\nTo reach the police office he had to go straight forward \\nand take the second turning to the left. It was only a few \\npaces away. But at the first turning he stopped and, after \\na minute’s thought, turned into a side street and went two \\nstreets out of his way, possibly without any object, or pos -\\nsibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking \\nat the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in \\nhis ear; he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at \\nthe very gate of the house. He had not passed it, he had not \\nbeen near it since that evening. An overwhelming, unac -\\ncountable prompting drew him on. He went into the house, \\npassed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on \\nthe right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the \\nfourth storey. The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comstopped at each landing and looked round him with curios -\\nity; on the first landing the framework of the window had \\nbeen taken out. ‘That wasn’t so then,’ he thought. Here was \\nthe flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had \\nbeen working. ‘It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So \\nit’s to let.’ Then the third storey and the fourth. ‘Here!’ He \\nwas perplexed to find the door of the flat wide open. There \\nwere men there, he could hear voices; he had not expected \\nthat. After brief hesitation he mounted the last stairs and \\nwent into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were \\nworkmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow \\nfancied that he would find everything as he left it, even per -\\nhaps the corpses in the same places on the floor. And now, \\nbare walls, no furniture; it seemed strange. He walked to \\nthe window and sat down on the window-sill. There were \\ntwo workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger \\nthan the other. They were papering the walls with a new \\nwhite paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, \\ndirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for some reason felt horribly \\nannoyed by this. He looked at the new paper with dislike, as \\nthough he felt sorry to have it all so changed. The workmen \\nhad obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were \\nhurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go \\nhome. They took no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they \\nwere talking.

He is bound to die within the next five \\nor ten minutes.’\\n‘Better bleed him then.’\\n‘If you like…. But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.’\\nAt that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the \\npassage parted, and the priest, a little, grey old man, ap -\\npeared in the doorway bearing the sacrament. A policeman \\nhad gone for him at the time of the accident. The doctor \\nchanged places with him, exchanging glances with him. \\nRaskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He \\nshrugged his shoulders and remained.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The \\ndying man probably understood little; he could only ut -\\nter indistinct broken sounds. Katerina Ivanovna took little \\nLida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt down in the cor -\\nner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of her. \\nThe little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on \\nhis little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing \\nhimself with precision and bowed down, touching the floor \\nwith his forehead, which seemed to afford him especial sat -\\nisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her lips and held back her \\ntears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the \\nboy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders \\nwith a kerchief, which she took from the chest without ris -\\ning from her knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door \\nfrom the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again. In \\nthe passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the \\nstaircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture \\nbeyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the \\nscene.\\nAt that moment Polenka forced her way through the \\ncrowd at the door. She came in panting from running so \\nfast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up \\nto her and said, ‘She’s coming, I met her in the street.’ Her \\nmother made her kneel beside her.\\nTimidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way \\nthrough the crowd, and strange was her appearance in \\nthat room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair. \\nShe, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but \\ndecked out in gutter finery of a special stamp, unmistakably \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combetraying its shameful purpose.

Lie do-own!’ cried Katerina Ivanovna.\\nWith unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping \\nhimself on his elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some \\ntime on his daughter, as though not recognising her. He had \\nnever seen her before in such attire. Suddenly he recognised \\nher, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and gaudy \\nfinery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dy -\\ning father. His face showed intense suffering.\\n‘Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!’ he cried, and he tried to hold \\nout his hand to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the \\nsofa, face downwards on the floor. They rushed to pick him \\nup, they put him on the sofa; but he was dying. Sonia with Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so without \\nmoving. He died in her arms.\\n‘He’s got what he wanted,’ Katerina Ivanovna cried, see -\\ning her husband’s dead body. ‘Well, what’s to be done now? \\nHow am I to bury him! What can I give them to-morrow \\nto eat?’\\nRaskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\\n‘Katerina Ivanovna,’ he began, ‘last week your husband \\ntold me all his life and circumstances…. Believe me, he \\nspoke of you with passionate reverence. From that evening, \\nwhen I learnt how devoted he was to you all and how he \\nloved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna, in \\nspite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we be -\\ncame friends….

Good-bye!’\\nAnd he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way \\nthrough the crowd to the stairs. But in the crowd he sud -\\ndenly jostled against Nikodim Fomitch, who had heard of \\nthe accident and had come to give instructions in person. \\nThey had not met since the scene at the police station, but \\nNikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\\n‘Ah, is that you?’ he asked him.\\n‘He’s dead,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘The doctor and the \\npriest have been, all as it should have been. Don’t worry the \\npoor woman too much, she is in consumption as it is. Try \\nand cheer her up, if possible … you are a kind-hearted man, \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI know …’ he added with a smile, looking straight in his \\nface.\\n‘But you are spattered with blood,’ observed Nikodim \\nFomitch, noticing in the lamplight some fresh stains on \\nRaskolnikov’s waistcoat.\\n‘Yes … I’m covered with blood,’ Raskolnikov said with a \\npeculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\\nHe walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but \\nnot conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelm -\\ning sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly \\nwithin him. This sensation might be compared to that of a \\nman condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned. \\nHalfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest \\non his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a \\nsilent greeting with him. He was just descending the last \\nsteps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him. someone \\novertook him; it was Polenka. She was running after him, \\ncalling ‘Wait! wait!’\\nHe turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase \\nand stopped short a step above him. A dim light came in \\nfrom the yard. Raskolnikov could distinguish the child’s \\nthin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright child -\\nish smile. She had run after him with a message which she \\nwas evidently glad to give.\\n‘Tell me, what is your name? … and where do you live?’ \\nshe said hurriedly in a breathless voice.\\nHe laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her \\nwith a sort of rapture.

Pride and self-confidence grew continu -\\nally stronger in him; he was becoming a different man every \\nmoment. What was it had happened to work this revolution \\nin him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a \\nstraw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there \\nwas still life for him, that his life had not died with the old \\nwoman.’ Perhaps he was in too great a hurry with his con -\\nclusions, but he did not think of that.\\n‘But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in \\nher prayers,’ the idea struck him. ‘Well, that was … in case \\nof emergency,’ he added and laughed himself at his boyish \\nsally. He was in the best of spirits.\\nHe easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already \\nknown at Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him \\nthe way. Half-way upstairs he could hear the noise and ani -\\nmated conversation of a big gathering of people. The door \\nwas wide open on the stairs; he could hear exclamations and \\ndiscussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the company \\nconsisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the en -\\ntry, where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind \\na screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie \\nand savouries, brought up from the landlady’s kitchen. Ras -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comkolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran out delighted. At \\nthe first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal \\nto drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin \\nquite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\\n‘Listen,’ Raskolnikov hastened to say, ‘I’ve only just come \\nto tell you you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows \\nwhat may not happen to him. I can’t come in; I am so weak \\nthat I shall fall down directly. And so good evening and \\ngood-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.’\\n‘Do you know what? I’ll see you home.

But don’t you mind him \\n…’\\nFor half a minute both were silent.\\n‘Listen, Razumihin,’ began Raskolnikov, ‘I want to tell \\nyou plainly: I’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died \\n… I gave them all my money … and besides I’ve just been \\nkissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just \\nthe same … in fact I saw someone else there … with a flame-\\ncoloured feather … but I am talking nonsense; I am very \\nweak, support me … we shall be at the stairs directly …’\\n‘What’s the matter?

Nastasya, perhaps,’ observed Razumihin.\\n‘She is never in my room at this time and she must be in \\nbed long ago, but … I don’t care! Good-bye!’\\n‘What do you mean?

Raskolnikov was the first \\nto open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the door -\\nway, dumbfoundered.\\nHis mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had \\nbeen waiting an hour and a half for him. Why had he never \\nexpected, never thought of them, though the news that they \\nhad started, were on their way and would arrive immediate -\\nly, had been repeated to him only that day? They had spent \\nthat hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She \\nwas standing before them and had told them everything by \\nnow. They were beside themselves with alarm when they \\nheard of his ‘running away’ to-day, ill and, as they under -\\nstood from her story, delirious! ‘Good Heavens, what had \\nbecome of him?’ Both had been weeping, both had been in \\nanguish for that hour and a half.\\nA cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. \\nBoth rushed to him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden \\nintolerable sensation struck him like a thunderbolt. He did \\nnot lift his arms to embrace them, he could not. His mother Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him, laughed \\nand cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground, \\nfainting.\\nAnxiety, cries of horror, moans … Razumihin who was \\nstanding in the doorway flew into the room, seized the sick \\nman in his strong arms and in a moment had him on the \\nsofa.\\n‘It’s nothing, nothing!’ he cried to the mother and sister—\\n‘it’s only a faint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said \\nhe was much better, that he is perfectly well! Water!

Razumihin was in extraordinary excitement.

Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all \\nthat he had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled \\neffect. He stood with the two ladies, seizing both by their \\nhands, persuading them, and giving them reasons with as -\\ntonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every word he \\nuttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed \\ntheir hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Ro -\\nmanovna without the least regard for good manners.

But though Avdotya \\nRomanovna shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous \\ndisposition, she could not see the glowing light in his eyes \\nwithout wonder and almost alarm. It was only the un -\\nbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her \\nbrother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to \\nrun away from him, and to persuade her mother to do the \\nsame. She realised, too, that even running away was per -\\nhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later, however, she was \\nconsiderably reassured; it was characteristic of Razumihin \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthat he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he \\nmight be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they \\nhad to deal with.\\n‘You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!’ he \\ncried. ‘If you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive \\nhim to a frenzy, and then goodness knows what will hap -\\npen!

What will happen, what will happen? \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAnd how he talked to you, Dounia!’ said the mother, look -\\ning timidly at her daughter, trying to read her thoughts \\nand, already half consoled by Dounia’s standing up for her \\nbrother, which meant that she had already forgiven him. ‘I \\nam sure he will think better of it to-morrow,’ she added, \\nprobing her further.\\n‘And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow … \\nabout that,’ Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, \\nthere was no going beyond that, for this was a point which \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was afraid to discuss. Dounia went \\nup and kissed her mother. The latter warmly embraced her \\nwithout speaking. Then she sat down to wait anxiously for \\nRazumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who \\nwalked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in \\nthought. This walking up and down when she was thinking \\nwas a habit of Avdotya Romanovna’s and the mother was \\nalways afraid to break in on her daughter’s mood at such \\nmoments.\\nRazumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden \\ndrunken infatuation for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart \\nfrom his eccentric condition, many people would have \\nthought it justified if they had seen Avdotya Romanov -\\nna, especially at that moment when she was walking to \\nand fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Av -\\ndotya Romanovna was remarkably good looking; she was \\ntall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant—\\nthe latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though \\nit did not in the least detract from the grace and softness \\nof her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18she might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was \\ndark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s; there was \\na proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a \\nlook of extraordinary kindness. She was pale, but it was \\na healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and \\nvigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip \\nprojected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregular -\\nity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual \\nand almost haughty expression. Her face was always more \\nserious and thoughtful than gay; but how well smiles, how \\nwell youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible, laughter suited \\nher face! It was natural enough that a warm, open, simple-\\nhearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen \\nanyone like her and was not quite sober at the time, should \\nlose his head immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, \\nhe saw Dounia for the first time transfigured by her love for \\nher brother and her joy at meeting him. Afterwards he saw \\nher lower lip quiver with indignation at her brother’s inso -\\nlent, cruel and ungrateful words—and his fate was sealed.\\nHe had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out \\nin his drunken talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, \\nRaskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, would be jealous of Pul -\\ncheria Alexandrovna as well as of Avdotya Romanovna on \\nhis account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-\\nthree, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she \\nlooked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost \\nalways the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, \\nsensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age. \\nWe may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comonly means of retaining beauty to old age. Her hair had be -\\ngun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s \\nfoot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and \\nsunken from anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome \\nface. She was Dounia over again, twenty years older, but \\nwithout the projecting underlip. Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nwas emotional, but not sentimental, timid and yielding, \\nbut only to a certain point. She could give way and accept \\na great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, \\nbut there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle \\nand the deepest convictions which nothing would induce \\nher to cross.\\nExactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, \\nthere came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he \\nhad come back.\\n‘I won’t come in, I haven’t time,’ he hastened to say when \\nthe door was opened. ‘He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, \\nand God grant he may sleep ten hours.

What was he beside such a girl—he, the drunken \\nnoisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so \\nabsurd and cynical a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed \\ndesperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection \\nforced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night \\non the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya \\nRomanovna … that was simply intolerable.

He hadn’t another suit—if he had had, \\nperhaps he wouldn’t have put it on. ‘I would have made a \\npoint of not putting it on.’ But in any case he could not re -\\nmain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend \\nthe feelings of others, especially when they were in need of \\nhis assistance and asking him to see them.

She locked herself \\nin, made no reply to my bonjour  through the door; she was \\nup at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her from \\nthe kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview….’Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodg -\\nings at Bakaleyev’s house. Both ladies were waiting for him \\nwith nervous impatience. They had risen at seven o’clock or \\nearlier. He entered looking as black as night, bowed awk -\\nwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He had \\nreckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly \\nrushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost \\nkissing them. He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, \\nbut her proud countenance wore at that moment an expres -\\nsion of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and \\nunlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-\\ndisguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into \\ngreater confusion than if he had been met with abuse. For -\\ntunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made \\nhaste to snatch at it.\\nHearing that everything was going well and that Rodya \\nhad not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that \\nshe was glad to hear it, because ‘she had something which it \\nwas very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.’ Then fol -\\nlowed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have \\nit with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya \\nRomanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty \\nwaiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at \\nlast, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies \\nwere ashamed. Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, \\nbut, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and \\nwas greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s questions, \\nwhich showered in a continual stream upon him.\\nHe talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.cominterrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describ -\\ning to them all the most important facts he knew of the last \\nyear of Raskolnikov’s life, concluding with a circumstantial \\naccount of his illness. He omitted, however, many things, \\nwhich were better omitted, including the scene at the po -\\nlice station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly \\nto his story, and, when he thought he had finished and sat -\\nisfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had \\nhardly begun.\\n‘Tell me, tell me! What do you think … ? Excuse me, I \\nstill don’t know your name!’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna put \\nin hastily.\\n‘Dmitri Prokofitch.’\\n‘I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch \\n… how he looks … on things in general now, that is, how can \\nI explain, what are his likes and dislikes? Is he always so ir -\\nritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, \\nhis dreams? Under what influences is he now? In a word, I \\nshould like …’\\n‘Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?’ ob -\\nserved Dounia.\\n‘Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least \\nlike this, Dmitri Prokofitch!’\\n‘Naturally,’ answered Razumihin. ‘I have no mother, but \\nmy uncle comes every year and almost every time he can \\nscarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a \\nclever man; and your three years’ separation means a great \\ndeal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for a year \\nand a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18of late—and perhaps for a long time before—he has been \\nsuspicious and fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind \\nheart. He does not like showing his feelings and would rath -\\ner do a cruel thing than open his heart freely. Sometimes, \\nthough, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhu -\\nmanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between \\ntwo characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says \\nhe is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies \\nin bed doing nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because \\nhe hasn’t the wit, but as though he hadn’t time to waste on \\nsuch trifles. He never listens to what is said to him. He is \\nnever interested in what interests other people at any given \\nmoment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is \\nright. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most \\nbeneficial influence upon him.’\\n‘God grant it may,’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, dis -\\ntressed by Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.\\nAnd Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Av -\\ndotya Romanovna at last. He glanced at her often while he \\nwas talking, but only for a moment and looked away again \\nat once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening at -\\ntentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro \\nwith her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasion -\\nally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. She \\nhad the same habit of not listening to what was said. She \\nwas wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white \\ntransparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon de -\\ntected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings. Had \\nAvdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhe would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she \\nwas poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her \\nsurroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began \\nto be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, \\nwhich was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.\\n‘You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my \\nbrother’s character … and have told it impartially. I am glad. \\nI thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,’ ob -\\nserved Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. ‘I think you are \\nright that he needs a woman’s care,’ she added thoughtful -\\nly.\\n‘I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only …’\\n‘What?’\\n‘He loves no one and perhaps he never will,’ Razumihin \\ndeclared decisively.\\n‘You mean he is not capable of love?’\\n‘Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like \\nyour brother, in everything, indeed!’ he blurted out sud -\\ndenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what \\nhe had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a \\ncrab and was overcome with confusion.

No, he would calmly have disregard -\\ned all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!’\\n‘He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,’ Razu -\\nmihin answered cautiously. ‘But I did hear something from \\nPraskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a \\ngossip. And what I heard certainly was rather strange.’\\n‘And what did you hear?’ both the ladies asked at once.\\n‘Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the mar -\\nriage, which only failed to take place through the girl’s \\ndeath, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They \\nsay, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told posi -\\ntively ugly … and such an invalid … and queer. But she \\nseems to have had some good qualities. She must have had \\nsome good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable…. She had no \\nmoney either and he wouldn’t have considered her money…. \\nBut it’s always difficult to judge in such matters.’\\n‘I am sure she was a good girl,’ Avdotya Romanovna ob -\\nserved briefly.\\n‘God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdon’t know which of them would have caused most misery \\nto the other—he to her or she to him,’ Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna concluded. Then she began tentatively questioning \\nhim about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hes -\\nitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to \\nthe latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest \\nevidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razu -\\nmihin described it in detail again, but this time he added \\nhis own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for \\nintentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to ex -\\ncuse him on the score of his illness.\\n‘He had planned it before his illness,’ he added.\\n‘I think so, too,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a \\ndejected air. But she was very much surprised at hearing \\nRazumihin express himself so carefully and even with a \\ncertain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch. Avdotya Romanov -\\nna, too, was struck by it.\\n‘So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?’ Pulcheria \\nAlexandrovna could not resist asking.\\n‘I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future \\nhusband,’ Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, \\n‘and I don’t say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because \\n… simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free \\nwill deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so rudely of him \\nlast night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and … \\nmad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely … \\nand this morning I am ashamed of it.’\\nHe crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanov -\\nna flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered Crime and Punishment \\x1810a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin.\\nWithout her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously \\ndid not know what to do. At last, faltering and continually \\nglancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceed -\\ningly worried by one circumstance.\\n‘You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,’ she began. ‘I’ll be perfectly \\nopen with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?’\\n‘Of course, mother,’ said Avdotya Romanovna emphati -\\ncally.\\n‘This is what it is,’ she began in haste, as though the \\npermission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her \\nmind. ‘Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr \\nPetrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. He \\npromised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of \\nthat he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodg -\\nings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he \\nwould be here himself this morning. But this morning this \\nnote came from him. You’d better read it yourself; there \\nis one point in it which worries me very much … you will \\nsoon see what that is, and … tell me your candid opinion, \\nDmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than \\nanyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dou -\\nnia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still \\ndon’t feel sure how to act and I … I’ve been waiting for your \\nopinion.’\\nRazumihin opened the note which was dated the previ -\\nous evening and read as follows:\\n‘Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the hon -\\nour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was \\x1811 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a \\nvery competent person with the same object in view.

This lasted an instant, however. \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking Zossimov, \\nespecially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\\n‘What! he saw you last night?’ Raskolnikov asked, as \\nthough startled. ‘Then you have not slept either after your \\njourney.’\\n‘Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock.

I simply don’t \\nunderstand it … and … and … it weighs upon me, indeed, \\nbecause I don’t understand it.

Why, you are in a senti -\\nmental mood to-day, are you?’ shouted Razumihin.\\nIf he had had more penetration he would have seen that \\nthere was no trace of sentimentality in him, but something \\nindeed quite the opposite. But Avdotya Romanovna noticed \\nit. She was intently and uneasily watching her brother.\\n‘As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,’ he went on, as \\nthough repeating a lesson learned by heart. ‘It is only to-\\nday that I have been able to realise a little how distressed \\nyou must have been here yesterday, waiting for me to come \\nback.’\\nWhen he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to \\nhis sister, smiling without a word. But in this smile there \\nwas a flash of real unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at \\nonce, and warmly pressed his hand, overjoyed and thank -\\nful. It was the first time he had addressed her since their \\ndispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up with \\necstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken \\nreconciliation. ‘Yes, that is what I love him for,’ Razumihin, \\nexaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous \\nturn in his chair. ‘He has these movements.’\\n‘And how well he does it all,’ the mother was thinking to \\nherself. ‘What generous impulses he has, and how simply, Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180how delicately he put an end to all the misunderstanding \\nwith his sister—simply by holding out his hand at the right \\nminute and looking at her like that….

Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s \\nbetter for you … and if you reach a line you won’t overstep, \\nyou will be unhappy … and if you overstep it, maybe you \\nwill be still unhappier….

I wrote \\nyou so much about her.’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘A-a-h! Yes, I remember…. So she’s dead! Oh, really?’ he \\nroused himself suddenly, as if waking up. ‘What did she die \\nof?’\\n‘Only imagine, quite suddenly,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nanswered hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. ‘On the \\nvery day I was sending you that letter! Would you believe it, \\nthat awful man seems to have been the cause of her death. \\nThey say he beat her dreadfully.’\\n‘Why, were they on such bad terms?’ he asked, address -\\ning his sister.\\n‘Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was \\nalways very patient, considerate even. In fact, all those sev -\\nen years of their married life he gave way to her, too much \\nso indeed, in many cases. All of a sudden he seems to have \\nlost patience.’\\n‘Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled \\nhimself for seven years?

What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much \\nindeed. She was such a sickly girl,’ he went on, growing \\ndreamy and looking down again. ‘Quite an invalid. She was \\nfond of giving alms to the poor, and was always dreaming \\nof a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she began \\ntalking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember \\nvery well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know \\nwhat drew me to her then—I think it was because she was \\nalways ill. If she had been lame or hunchback, I believe I \\nshould have liked her better still,’ he smiled dreamily. ‘Yes, \\nit was a sort of spring delirium.’\\n‘No, it was not only spring delirium,’ said Dounia, with \\nwarm feeling.\\nHe fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not \\nhear or did not understand her words. Then, completely \\nlost in thought, he got up, went up to his mother, kissed her, \\nwent back to his place and sat down.\\n‘You love her even now?’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, \\ntouched.\\n‘Her? Now? Oh, yes…. You ask about her? No … that’s \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comall now, as it were, in another world … and so long ago. \\nAnd indeed everything happening here seems somehow far \\naway.’ He looked attentively at them. ‘You, now … I seem to \\nbe looking at you from a thousand miles away … but, good -\\nness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use \\nof asking about it?’ he added with annoyance, and biting his \\nnails, fell into dreamy silence again.\\n‘What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a \\ntomb,’ said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the \\noppressive silence. ‘I am sure it’s quite half through your \\nlodging you have become so melancholy.’\\n‘My lodging,’ he answered, listlessly. ‘Yes, the lodging \\nhad a great deal to do with it…. I thought that, too…. If \\nonly you knew, though, what a strange thing you said just \\nnow, mother,’ he said, laughing strangely.\\nA little more, and their companionship, this mother and \\nthis sister, with him after three years’ absence, this intimate \\ntone of conversation, in face of the utter impossibility of re -\\nally speaking about anything, would have been beyond his \\npower of endurance. But there was one urgent matter which \\nmust be settled one way or the other that day—so he had \\ndecided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as \\na means of escape.\\n‘Listen, Dounia,’ he began, gravely and drily, ‘of course I \\nbeg your pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to \\ntell you again that I do not withdraw from my chief point.

He took it with great interest, but, before Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18opening it, he suddenly looked with a sort of wonder at \\nDounia.\\n‘It is strange,’ he said, slowly, as though struck by a new \\nidea. ‘What am I making such a fuss for? What is it all \\nabout? Marry whom you like!’\\nHe said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and \\nlooked for some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He \\nopened the letter at last, still with the same look of strange \\nwonder on his face. Then, slowly and attentively, he began \\nreading, and read it through twice. Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nshowed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected something \\nparticular.\\n‘What surprises me,’ he began, after a short pause, hand -\\ning the letter to his mother, but not addressing anyone in \\nparticular, ‘is that he is a business man, a lawyer, and his \\nconversation is pretentious indeed, and yet he writes such \\nan uneducated letter.’\\nThey all started. They had expected something quite dif -\\nferent.\\n‘But they all write like that, you know,’ Razumihin ob -\\nserved, abruptly.\\n‘Have you read it?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘We showed him, Rodya. We … consulted him just now,’ \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.\\n‘That’s just the jargon of the courts,’ Razumihin put in. \\n‘Legal documents are written like that to this day.’\\n‘Legal? Yes, it’s just legal—business language—not so very \\nuneducated, and not quite educated—business language!’\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had \\na cheap education, he is proud indeed of having made his \\nown way,’ Avdotya Romanovna observed, somewhat of -\\nfended by her brother’s tone.\\n‘Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You \\nseem to be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivo -\\nlous criticism on the letter, and to think that I speak of such \\ntrifling matters on purpose to annoy you. It is quite the con -\\ntrary, an observation apropos of the style occurred to me \\nthat is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There is one \\nexpression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and \\nplainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at \\nonce if I am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to \\na threat to abandon you both if you are disobedient, and to \\nabandon you now after summoning you to Petersburg. Well, \\nwhat do you think? Can one resent such an expression from \\nLuzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had \\nwritten it, or Zossimov, or one of us?’\\n‘N-no,’ answered Dounia, with more animation. ‘I saw \\nclearly that it was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps \\nhe simply has no skill in writing … that is a true criticism, \\nbrother. I did not expect, indeed …’\\n‘It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than per -\\nhaps he intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There \\nis one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and \\nrather a contemptible one. I gave the money last night to \\nthe widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, \\nand not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay for \\nthe funeral, and not to the daughter—a young woman, as Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18he writes, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for \\nthe first time in my life)—but to the widow. In all this I see \\na too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension be -\\ntween us. It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, \\nwith a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve \\neagerness.

How little did I think yester -\\nday in the train that I could ever be glad of that.’\\n‘I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see \\nit? Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be pa -\\ntient, and much, much can be forgiven.’\\n‘Well, you were not very patient!’ Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna caught her up, hotly and jealously. ‘Do you know, \\nDounia, I was looking at you two. You are the very portrait \\nof him, and not so much in face as in soul. You are both \\nmelancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty \\nand both generous….

Well, you may believe it \\nor not, but as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt \\nthat she was the chief cause of the trouble….’\\n‘Nothing of the sort!’ cried Dounia, in vexation. ‘What \\nnonsense, with your presentiments, mother!

Never, never had she felt \\nanything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new \\nworld was opening before her. She remembered suddenly \\nthat Raskolnikov meant to come to her that day, perhaps \\nat once!\\n‘Only not to-day, please, not to-day!’ she kept muttering \\nwith a sinking heart, as though entreating someone, like a \\nfrightened child. ‘Mercy! to me … to that room … he will \\nsee … oh, dear!’\\nShe was not capable at that instant of noticing an un -\\nknown gentleman who was watching her and following at \\nher heels. He had accompanied her from the gateway. At \\nthe moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood \\nstill at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was \\njust passing, started on hearing Sonia’s words: ‘and I asked \\nwhere Mr. Raskolnikov lived?’ He turned a rapid but atten -\\ntive look upon all three, especially upon Raskolnikov, to \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwhom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted the \\nhouse. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and try -\\ning not to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as \\nthough waiting for something. He was waiting for Sonia; he \\nsaw that they were parting, and that Sonia was going home.\\n‘Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,’ he \\nthought. ‘I must find out.’\\nAt the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw \\nSonia coming the same way, noticing nothing. She turned \\nthe corner. He followed her on the other side. After about \\nfifty paces he crossed over again, overtook her and kept two \\nor three yards behind her.\\nHe was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with \\nbroad high shoulders which made him look as though he \\nstooped a little. He wore good and fashionable clothes, and \\nlooked like a gentleman of position. He carried a handsome \\ncane, which he tapped on the pavement at each step; his \\ngloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face \\nwith high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen \\nin Petersburg. His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only \\ntouched here and there with grey, and his thick square beard \\nwas even lighter than his hair. His eyes were blue and had \\na cold and thoughtful look; his lips were crimson. He was a \\nremarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger \\nthan his years.\\nWhen Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the \\nonly two persons on the pavement. He observed her dream -\\niness and preoccupation. On reaching the house where she \\nlodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed her, seem -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18ing rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the \\nright corner. ‘Bah!’ muttered the unknown gentleman, and \\nmounted the stairs behind her. Only then Sonia noticed \\nhim. She reached the third storey, turned down the pas -\\nsage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed in chalk, \\n‘Kapernaumov, Tailor.’ ‘Bah!’ the stranger repeated again, \\nwondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next \\ndoor, at No. 8. The doors were two or three yards apart.\\n‘You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,’ he said, looking at Sonia \\nand laughing. ‘He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am \\nstaying close here at Madame Resslich’s. How odd!’ Sonia \\nlooked at him attentively.\\n‘We are neighbours,’ he went on gaily. ‘I only came to \\ntown the day before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.’\\nSonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. \\nShe felt for some reason ashamed and uneasy.\\n*****\\nOn the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously ex -\\ncited.\\n‘That’s capital, brother,’ he repeated several times, ‘and I \\nam glad! I am glad!’\\n‘What are you glad about?’ Raskolnikov thought to him -\\nself.\\n‘I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, \\ntoo. And … was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you \\nwere there?’\\n‘What a simple-hearted fool he is!’\\n‘When was it?’ Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. \\n‘Two or three days before her death it must have been. But \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI am not going to redeem the things now,’ he put in with a \\nsort of hurried and conspicuous solicitude about the things. \\n‘I’ve not more than a silver rouble left … after last night’s ac -\\ncursed delirium!’\\nHe laid special emphasis on the delirium.\\n‘Yes, yes,’ Razumihin hastened to agree—with what was \\nnot clear. ‘Then that’s why you … were stuck … partly … \\nyou know in your delirium you were continually mention -\\ning some rings or chains!

He came in \\nlooking as though he had the utmost difficulty not to \\nburst out laughing again. Behind him Razumihin strode in \\ngawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with \\nan utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face \\nand whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and \\namply justified Raskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not \\nwaiting for an introduction, bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, \\nwho stood in the middle of the room looking inquiringly at \\nthem. He held out his hand and shook hands, still apparent -\\nly making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a \\nfew words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner suc -\\nceeded in assuming a serious air and muttering something \\nwhen he suddenly glanced again as though accidentally at \\nRazumihin, and could no longer control himself: his stifled \\nlaughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried to \\nrestrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumi -\\nhin received this ‘spontaneous’ mirth gave the whole scene \\nthe appearance of most genuine fun and naturalness. Razu -\\nmihin strengthened this impression as though on purpose.\\n‘Fool! You fiend,’ he roared, waving his arm which at \\nonce struck a little round table with an empty tea-glass on \\nit. Everything was sent flying and crashing.\\n‘But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18the Crown,’ Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.\\nRaskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry \\nPetrovitch’s, but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right \\nmoment to put a natural end to it. Razumihin, completely \\nput to confusion by upsetting the table and smashing the \\nglass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and turned \\nsharply to the window where he stood looking out with his \\nback to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, \\nseeing nothing. Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready \\nto go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. \\nZametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the \\nvisitors’ entrance and was standing in expectation with a \\nsmile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even \\nit seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov \\nwith a certain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected pres -\\nence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.\\n‘I’ve got to think of that,’ he thought. ‘Excuse me, please,’ \\nhe began, affecting extreme embarrassment. ‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Not at all, very pleasant to see you … and how pleasantly \\nyou’ve come in…. Why, won’t he even say good-morning?’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.\\n‘Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage \\nwith me. I only told him as we came along that he was like \\nRomeo … and proved it. And that was all, I think!’\\n‘Pig!’ ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\n‘There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is \\nso furious at the word,’ Porfiry laughed.\\n‘Oh, you sharp lawyer! … Damn you all!’ snapped Razu -\\nmihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comup to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing \\nhad happened. ‘That’ll do! We are all fools. To come to busi -\\nness. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; \\nin the first place he has heard of you and wants to make \\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of \\nbusiness with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? \\nHave you met before? Have you known each other long?’\\n‘What does this mean?’ thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\n‘Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,’ he said eas -\\nily.\\n‘Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was \\nbegging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have \\nsniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very \\nclean linen, and trodden-down slippers.

It \\nwould have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, \\nwhich shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost \\nwhite, blinking eyelashes.

Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready \\nto go on laughing, but obviously looked for explanations. \\nZametov had been sitting in the corner, but he rose at the \\nvisitors’ entrance and was standing in expectation with a \\nsmile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and even \\nit seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov \\nwith a certain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected pres -\\nence struck Raskolnikov unpleasantly.\\n‘I’ve got to think of that,’ he thought. ‘Excuse me, please,’ \\nhe began, affecting extreme embarrassment. ‘Raskolnikov.’\\n‘Not at all, very pleasant to see you … and how pleasantly \\nyou’ve come in…. Why, won’t he even say good-morning?’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch nodded at Razumihin.\\n‘Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage \\nwith me. I only told him as we came along that he was like \\nRomeo … and proved it. And that was all, I think!’\\n‘Pig!’ ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.\\n‘There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is \\nso furious at the word,’ Porfiry laughed.\\n‘Oh, you sharp lawyer! … Damn you all!’ snapped Razu -\\nmihin, and suddenly bursting out laughing himself, he went \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comup to Porfiry with a more cheerful face as though nothing \\nhad happened. ‘That’ll do! We are all fools. To come to busi -\\nness. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov; \\nin the first place he has heard of you and wants to make \\nyour acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of \\nbusiness with you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? \\nHave you met before? Have you known each other long?’\\n‘What does this mean?’ thought Raskolnikov uneasily.\\nZametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.\\n‘Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,’ he said eas -\\nily.\\n‘Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was \\nbegging me to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have \\nsniffed each other out without me. Where is your tobacco?’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very \\nclean linen, and trodden-down slippers. He was a man of \\nabout five and thirty, short, stout even to corpulence, and \\nclean shaven. He wore his hair cut short and had a large \\nround head, particularly prominent at the back. His soft, \\nround, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish co -\\nlour, but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It \\nwould have been good-natured except for a look in the eyes, \\nwhich shone with a watery, mawkish light under almost \\nwhite, blinking eyelashes. The expression of those eyes was \\nstrangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish fig -\\nure, and gave it something far more serious than could be \\nguessed at first sight.\\nAs soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had \\na little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, \\nwaiting for him to explain his business, with that careful \\nand over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and \\nembarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if \\nwhat you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little \\nimportance for such exceptional solemnity. But in brief and \\ncoherent phrases Raskolnikov explained his business clear -\\nly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that \\nhe even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry. Porfiry \\nPetrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin, \\nsitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and im -\\npatiently, looking from one to the other every moment with \\nrather excessive interest.\\n‘Fool,’ Raskolnikov swore to himself.\\n‘You have to give information to the police,’ Porfiry re -\\nplied, with a most businesslike air, ‘that having learnt of \\nthis incident, that is of the murder, you beg to inform the \\nlawyer in charge of the case that such and such things be -\\nlong to you, and that you desire to redeem them … or … but \\nthey will write to you.’\\n‘That’s just the point, that at the present moment,’ Ras -\\nkolnikov tried his utmost to feign embarrassment, ‘I am not \\nquite in funds … and even this trifling sum is beyond me \\n… I only wanted, you see, for the present to declare that the \\nthings are mine, and that when I have money….’\\n‘That’s no matter,’ answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving \\nhis explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, ‘but you \\ncan, if you prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having \\nbeen informed of the matter, and claiming such and such \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comas your property, you beg …’\\n‘On an ordinary sheet of paper?’ Raskolnikov inter -\\nrupted eagerly, again interested in the financial side of the \\nquestion.\\n‘Oh, the most ordinary,’ and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch \\nlooked with obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, \\nas it were, winking at him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s \\nfancy, for it all lasted but a moment. There was certainly \\nsomething of the sort, Raskolnikov could have sworn he \\nwinked at him, goodness knows why.\\n‘He knows,’ flashed through his mind like lightning.\\n‘Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,’ he went \\non, a little disconcerted, ‘the things are only worth five \\nroubles, but I prize them particularly for the sake of those \\nfrom whom they came to me, and I must confess that I was \\nalarmed when I heard …’\\n‘That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned \\nto Zossimov that Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who \\nhad pledges!’ Razumihin put in with obvious intention.\\nThis was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help \\nglancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black \\neyes, but immediately recollected himself.\\n‘You seem to be jeering at me, brother?’ he said to him, \\nwith a well- feigned irritability. ‘I dare say I do seem to you \\nabsurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn’t think \\nme selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be \\nanything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the \\nsilver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the only thing \\nleft us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18is here,’ he turned suddenly to Porfiry, ‘and if she knew,’ he \\nturned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his \\nvoice tremble, ‘that the watch was lost, she would be in de -\\nspair! You know what women are!’\\n‘Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the con -\\ntrary!’ shouted Razumihin distressed.\\n‘Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?’ Raskol -\\nnikov asked himself in a tremor. ‘Why did I say that about \\nwomen?’\\n‘Oh, your mother is with you?’ Porfiry Petrovitch in -\\nquired.\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘When did she come?’\\n‘Last night.’\\nPorfiry paused as though reflecting.\\n‘Your things would not in any case be lost,’ he went on \\ncalmly and coldly. ‘I have been expecting you here for some \\ntime.’\\nAnd as though that was a matter of no importance, he \\ncarefully offered the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruth -\\nlessly scattering cigarette ash over the carpet. Raskolnikov \\nshuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be looking at him, \\nand was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.\\n‘What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had \\npledges there ?’ cried Razumihin.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.\\n‘Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up \\ntogether, and on the paper your name was legibly written in \\npencil, together with the date on which you left them with \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comher …’\\n‘How observant you are!’ Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, \\ndoing his very utmost to look him straight in the face, but \\nhe failed, and suddenly added:\\n‘I say that because I suppose there were a great many \\npledges … that it must be difficult to remember them all…. \\nBut you remember them all so clearly, and … and …’\\n‘Stupid! Feeble!’ he thought. ‘Why did I add that?’\\n‘But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only \\none who hasn’t come forward,’ Porfiry answered with hard -\\nly perceptible irony.\\n‘I haven’t been quite well.’\\n‘I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great \\ndistress about something. You look pale still.’\\n‘I am not pale at all…. No, I am quite well,’ Raskolnikov \\nsnapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his \\ntone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. ‘And \\nin my anger I shall betray myself,’ flashed through his mind \\nagain. ‘Why are they torturing me?’\\n‘Not quite well!’ Razumihin caught him up. ‘What next! \\nHe was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would \\nyou believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he \\ndressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip \\nand went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious \\nall the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!’\\n‘Really delirious? You don’t say so!’ Porfiry shook his \\nhead in a womanish way.\\n‘Nonsense! Don’t you believe it!

But Porfiry Petro -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180vitch did not seem to catch those strange words.\\n‘But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been de -\\nlirious?’ Razumihin got hot suddenly. ‘What did you go out \\nfor?

You \\ngave your last penny to the widow for the funeral. If you \\nwanted to help, give fifteen or twenty even, but keep three \\nroubles for yourself at least, but he flung away all the twenty-\\nfive at once!’\\n‘Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know \\nnothing of it? So that’s why I was liberal yesterday…. Mr. \\nZametov knows I’ve found a treasure! Excuse us, please, for \\ndisturbing you for half an hour with such trivialities,’ he \\nsaid, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with trembling lips. ‘We \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comare boring you, aren’t we?’\\n‘Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only \\nyou knew how you interest me! It’s interesting to look on \\nand listen … and I am really glad you have come forward \\nat last.’\\n‘But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,’ cried \\nRazumihin.\\n‘Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. \\nWouldn’t you like … something more essential before tea?’\\n‘Get along with you!’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.\\nRaskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in ter -\\nrible exasperation.\\n‘The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care \\nto stand on ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at \\nall, did you come to talk to Nikodim Fomitch about me? \\nSo they don’t care to hide that they are tracking me like \\na pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.’ He was shak -\\ning with rage. ‘Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me \\nlike a cat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, \\nbut perhaps I won’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the \\nwhole truth in your ugly faces, and you’ll see how I despise \\nyou.’ He could hardly breathe. ‘And what if it’s only my fan -\\ncy? What if I am mistaken, and through inexperience I get \\nangry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s all un -\\nintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there \\nis something about them…. It all might be said, but there \\nis something. Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did \\nZametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18that tone? Yes, the tone…. Razumihin is sitting here, why \\ndoes he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does \\nsee anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just \\nnow? Of course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are \\nthey trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Ei -\\nther it’s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude…. Is \\nZametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw \\nhe would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s \\nmy first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits \\nwith his back to him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, \\nover me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before \\nwe came. Do they know about the flat? If only they’d make \\nhaste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it \\npass…. I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use \\nafterwards…. Delirious, indeed … ha-ha-ha! He knows all \\nabout last night! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! \\nThe hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, \\nyou won’t catch me! There are no facts … it’s all supposition! \\nYou produce facts! The flat even isn’t a fact but delirium. I \\nknow what to say to them…. Do they know about the flat? I \\nwon’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my \\nbeing angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! \\nPerhaps that’s right; to play the invalid…. He is feeling me. \\nHe will try to catch me. Why did I come?’\\nAll this flashed like lightning through his mind.\\nPorfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became sudden -\\nly more jovial.\\n‘Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather…. \\nAnd I am out of sorts altogether,’ he began in quite a differ -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.coment tone, laughing to Razumihin.\\n‘Was it interesting?

No, brother, you are \\nwrong, environment accounts for a great deal in crime; I \\ncan assure you of that.’\\n‘Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty vio -\\nlates a child of ten; was it environment drove him to it?’\\n‘Well, strictly speaking, it did,’ Porfiry observed with \\nnoteworthy gravity; ‘a crime of that nature may be very well \\nascribed to the influence of environment.’\\nRazumihin was almost in a frenzy. ‘Oh, if you like,’ he \\nroared. ‘I’ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very \\nwell be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great’s being \\ntwo hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, \\nexactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency! I \\nundertake to! Will you bet on it?’\\n‘Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!’\\n‘He is always humbugging, confound him,’ cried Razu -\\nmihin, jumping up and gesticulating. ‘What’s the use of \\ntalking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don’t know \\nhim, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make \\nfools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they \\nwere delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. \\nLast year he persuaded us that he was going into a monas -\\ntery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it \\ninto his head to declare he was going to get married, that \\nhe had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new \\nclothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There \\nwas no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!’\\n‘Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18new clothes in fact that made me think of taking you in.’\\n‘Are you such a good dissembler?’ Raskolnikov asked \\ncarelessly.\\n‘You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall \\ntake you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All \\nthese questions about crime, environment, children, recall \\nto my mind an article of yours which interested me at the \\ntime. ‘On Crime’ … or something of the sort, I forget the \\ntitle, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the Periodi -\\ncal Review . ’\\n‘My article? In the Periodical Review ?’ Raskolnikov asked \\nin astonishment. ‘I certainly did write an article upon a \\nbook six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it \\nto the Weekly Review . ’\\n‘But it came out in the Periodical . ’\\n‘And the Weekly Review  ceased to exist, so that’s why it \\nwasn’t printed at the time.’\\n‘That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the Weekly Re -\\nview  was amalgamated with the Periodical  and so your \\narticle appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn’t you \\nknow?’\\nRaskolnikov had not known.\\n‘Why, you might get some money out of them for the \\narticle! What a strange person you are! You lead such a soli -\\ntary life that you know nothing of matters that concern you \\ndirectly. It’s a fact, I assure you.’\\n‘Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!’ cried Ra -\\nzumihin. ‘I’ll run to-day to the reading-room and ask for \\nthe number. Two months ago? What was the date? It doesn’t \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commatter though, I will find it. Think of not telling us!’\\n‘How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only \\nsigned with an initial.’\\n‘I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the edi -\\ntor; I know him…. I was very much interested.’\\n‘I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal \\nbefore and after the crime.’\\n‘Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime \\nis always accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but \\n… it was not that part of your article that interested me so \\nmuch, but an idea at the end of the article which I regret \\nto say you merely suggested without working it out clearly. \\nThere is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are certain \\npersons who can … that is, not precisely are able to, but \\nhave a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and \\ncrimes, and that the law is not for them.’\\nRaskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional \\ndistortion of his idea.\\n‘What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not \\nbecause of the influence of environment?’ Razumihin in -\\nquired with some alarm even.\\n‘No, not exactly because of it,’ answered Porfiry. ‘In his \\narticle all men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordi -\\nnary.’ Ordinary men have to live in submission, have no \\nright to transgress the law, because, don’t you see, they are \\nordinary.

In short, I maintain that all great men or even men \\na little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving \\nsome new word, must from their very nature be criminals—\\nmore or less, of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get \\nout of the common rut; and to remain in the common rut is \\nwhat they can’t submit to, from their very nature again, and \\nto my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to it. You see \\nthat there is nothing particularly new in all that. The same \\nthing has been printed and read a thousand times before. \\nAs for my division of people into ordinary and extraordi -\\nnary, I acknowledge that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t \\ninsist upon exact numbers. I only believe in my leading \\nidea that men are in general  divided by a law of nature into \\ntwo categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say, mate -\\nrial that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who \\nhave the gift or the talent to utter a new word . There are, of \\ncourse, innumerable sub- divisions, but the distinguishing \\nfeatures of both categories are fairly well marked. The first \\ncategory, generally speaking, are men conservative in tem -\\nperament and law-abiding; they live under control and love Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty to be con -\\ntrolled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing \\nhumiliating in it for them. The second category all trans -\\ngress the law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction \\naccording to their capacities. The crimes of these men are \\nof course relative and varied; for the most part they seek in \\nvery varied ways the destruction of the present for the sake \\nof the better. But if such a one is forced for the sake of his \\nidea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I \\nmaintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction \\nfor wading through blood—that depends on the idea and \\nits dimensions, note that. It’s only in that sense I speak of \\ntheir right to crime in my article (you remember it began \\nwith the legal question). There’s no need for such anxiety, \\nhowever; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they \\npunish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so \\nfulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same \\nmasses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next genera -\\ntion and worship them (more or less). The first category is \\nalways the man of the present, the second the man of the \\nfuture. The first preserve the world and people it, the sec -\\nond move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has \\nan equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with \\nme—and vive la guerre éternelle —till the New Jerusalem, \\nof course!’\\n‘Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?’\\n‘I do,’ Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these \\nwords and during the whole preceding tirade he kept his \\neyes on one spot on the carpet.\\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘And … and do you believe in God? Excuse my curios -\\nity.’\\n‘I do,’ repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.\\n‘And … do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?’\\n‘I … I do. Why do you ask all this?’\\n‘You believe it literally?’\\n‘Literally.’\\n‘You don’t say so…. I asked from curiosity.

But at the very mo -\\nment, he was struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, \\nand the eagerness with which he had made this explanation, \\nthough he had kept up all the preceding conversation with \\ngloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive, from necessity.\\n‘I am getting a relish for certain aspects!’ he thought to \\nhimself. But almost at the same instant he became suddenly \\nuneasy, as though an unexpected and alarming idea had oc -\\ncurred to him. His uneasiness kept on increasing. They had \\njust reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.\\n‘Go in alone!’ said Raskolnikov suddenly. ‘I will be back Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18directly.’\\n‘Where are you going? Why, we are just here.’\\n‘I can’t help it…. I will come in half an hour. Tell them.’\\n‘Say what you like, I will come with you.’\\n‘You, too, want to torture me!’ he screamed, with such \\nbitter irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumi -\\nhin’s hands dropped. He stood for some time on the steps, \\nlooking gloomily at Raskolnikov striding rapidly away in \\nthe direction of his lodging. At last, gritting his teeth and \\nclenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry like \\na lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure \\nPulcheria Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their \\nlong absence.\\nWhen Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with \\nsweat and he was breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the \\nstairs, walked into his unlocked room and at once fastened \\nthe latch. Then in senseless terror he rushed to the corner, \\nto that hole under the paper where he had put the things; \\nput his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the \\nhole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, \\nhe got up and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the \\nsteps of Bakaleyev’s, he suddenly fancied that something, a \\nchain, a stud or even a bit of paper in which they had been \\nwrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it, might \\nsomehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and \\nthen might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evi -\\ndence against him.\\nHe stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, hu -\\nmiliated, half senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcap at last and went quietly out of the room. His ideas were \\nall tangled. He went dreamily through the gateway.\\n‘Here he is himself,’ shouted a loud voice.\\nHe raised his head.\\nThe porter was standing at the door of his little room \\nand was pointing him out to a short man who looked like \\nan artisan, wearing a long coat and a waistcoat, and look -\\ning at a distance remarkably like a woman. He stooped, and \\nhis head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled \\nflabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat \\nand they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\\n‘What is it?’ Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\\nThe man stole a look at him from under his brows and \\nhe looked at him attentively, deliberately; then he turned \\nslowly and went out of the gate into the street without say -\\ning a word.\\n‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.\\n‘Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, \\nmentioned your name and whom you lodged with. I saw \\nyou coming and pointed you out and he went away. It’s fun -\\nny.’\\nThe porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, \\nand after wondering for a moment he turned and went back \\nto his room.\\nRaskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught \\nsight of him walking along the other side of the street with \\nthe same even, deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the \\nground, as though in meditation.

The images followed one another, whirling \\nlike a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried to clutch \\nat, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression \\nwithin him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was \\neven pleasant…. The slight shivering still persisted, but that \\ntoo was an almost pleasant sensation.\\nHe heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed \\nhis eyes and pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18door and stood for some time in the doorway as though \\nhesitating, then he stepped softly into the room and went \\ncautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s whis -\\nper:\\n‘Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his din -\\nner later.’\\n‘Quite so,’ answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully \\nand closed the door. Another half-hour passed. Raskol -\\nnikov opened his eyes, turned on his back again, clasping \\nhis hands behind his head.\\n‘Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? \\nWhere was he, what did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. \\nWhere was he then? And from where did he see? Why has \\nhe only now sprung out of the earth? And how could he see? \\nIs it possible? Hm …’ continued Raskolnikov, turning cold \\nand shivering, ‘and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the \\ndoor—was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal \\nline and you can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly \\nflew by and saw it! Is it possible?’ He felt with sudden loath -\\ning how weak, how physically weak he had become. ‘I ought \\nto have known it,’ he thought with a bitter smile. ‘And how \\ndared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take \\nup an axe and shed blood! I ought to have known before -\\nhand…. Ah, but I did know!’ he whispered in despair. At \\ntimes he came to a standstill at some thought.\\n‘No, those men are not made so. The real Master  to whom \\nall is permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, \\nforgets  an army in Egypt, wastes  half a million men in the \\nMoscow expedition and gets off with a jest at Vilna. And al -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtars are set up to him after his death, and so all is permitted. \\nNo, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but of bronze!’\\nOne sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Na -\\npoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old \\nwoman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed—it’s \\na nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest! How can they \\ndigest it! It’s too inartistic. ‘A Napoleon creep under an old \\nwoman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!’\\nAt moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of \\nfeverish excitement. ‘The old woman is of no consequence,’ \\nhe thought, hotly and incoherently. ‘The old woman was a \\nmistake perhaps, but she is not what matters! The old wom -\\nan was only an illness…. I was in a hurry to overstep…. I \\ndidn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the prin -\\nciple, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side…. I was \\nonly capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable \\nof that … Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abus -\\ning the socialists? They are industrious, commercial people; \\n‘the happiness of all’ is their case. No, life is only given to \\nme once and I shall never have it again; I don’t want to wait \\nfor ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself, or else better \\nnot live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother starving, \\nkeeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the ‘hap -\\npiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness \\nof all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let \\nme slip? I only live once, I too want…. Ech, I am an æsthetic \\nlouse and nothing more,’ he added suddenly, laughing like a \\nmadman. ‘Yes, I am certainly a louse,’ he went on, clutching \\nat the idea, gloating over it and playing with it with vindic -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180tive pleasure. ‘In the first place, because I can reason that I \\nam one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been \\ntroubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that \\nnot for my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a \\ngrand and noble object— ha-ha!

He crossed over to him, \\nbut at once the man turned and walked away with his head \\nhanging, as though he had made no sign to him. ‘Stay, did \\nhe really beckon?’ Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried to \\novertake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised \\nhim and was frightened; it was the same man with stooping \\nshoulders in the long coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18distance; his heart was beating; they went down a turning; \\nthe man still did not look round. ‘Does he know I am fol -\\nlowing him?’ thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the \\ngateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate \\nand looked in to see whether he would look round and sign \\nto him. In the court-yard the man did turn round and again \\nseemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at once followed him \\ninto the yard, but the man was gone. He must have gone \\nup the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He \\nheard slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase \\nseemed strangely familiar. He reached the window on the \\nfirst floor; the moon shone through the panes with a melan -\\ncholy and mysterious light; then he reached the second floor. \\nBah! this is the flat where the painters were at work … but \\nhow was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps of the \\nman above had died away. ‘So he must have stopped or hid -\\nden somewhere.’ He reached the third storey, should he go \\non? There was a stillness that was dreadful…. But he went \\non. The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened \\nhim. How dark it was! The man must be hiding in some cor -\\nner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated \\nand went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as \\nthough everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe \\ninto the parlour which was flooded with moonlight. Every -\\nthing there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the \\nyellow sofa and the pictures in the frames. A huge, round, \\ncopper-red moon looked in at the windows. ‘It’s the moon \\nthat makes it so still, weaving some mystery,’ thought Ras -\\nkolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commore silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, \\ntill it was painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he \\nheard a momentary sharp crack like the snapping of a splin -\\nter and all was still again. A fly flew up suddenly and struck \\nthe window pane with a plaintive buzz. At that moment he \\nnoticed in the corner between the window and the little \\ncupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. ‘Why \\nis that cloak here?’ he thought, ‘it wasn’t there before….’ He \\nwent up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding \\nbehind it. He cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on \\na chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he \\ncouldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over her. ‘She \\nis afraid,’ he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the \\nnoose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. \\nBut strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made \\nof wood.

(I am \\nanticipating you.) But you’ve only to assume that I, too, am \\na man et nihil humanum  … in a word, that I am capable of \\nbeing attracted and falling in love (which does not depend \\non our will), then everything can be explained in the most \\nnatural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I \\nmyself a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing \\nto the object of my passion to elope with me to America or \\nSwitzerland, I may have cherished the deepest respect for \\nher and may have thought that I was promoting our mutual \\nhappiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why, \\nprobably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!’\\n‘But that’s not the point,’ Raskolnikov interrupted with \\ndisgust. ‘It’s simply that whether you are right or wrong, we \\ndislike you. We don’t want to have anything to do with you. \\nWe show you the door. Go out!’\\nSvidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.\\n‘But you’re … but there’s no getting round you,’ he said, \\nlaughing in the frankest way. ‘I hoped to get round you, but \\nyou took up the right line at once!’\\n‘But you are trying to get round me still!’\\n‘What of it? What of it?’ cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing \\nopenly. ‘But this is what the French call bonne guerre  and \\nthe most innocent form of deception! … But still you have \\ninterrupted me; one way or another, I repeat again: there \\nwould never have been any unpleasantness except for what \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhappened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna …’\\n‘You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?’ \\nRaskolnikov interrupted rudely.\\n‘Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, \\nthough…. But as for your question, I really don’t know what \\nto say, though my own conscience is quite at rest on that \\nscore. Don’t suppose that I am in any apprehension about it. \\nAll was regular and in order; the medical inquiry diagnosed \\napoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy dinner \\nand a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved noth -\\ning else. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself \\nof late, on my way here in the train, especially: didn’t I con -\\ntribute to all that … calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation \\nor something of the sort. But I came to the conclusion that \\nthat, too, was quite out of the question.’\\nRaskolnikov laughed.\\n‘I wonder you trouble yourself about it!’\\n‘But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her \\njust twice with a switch—there were no marks even … don’t \\nregard me as a cynic, please; I am perfectly aware how atro -\\ncious it was of me and all that; but I know for certain, too, \\nthat Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased at my, so to say, \\nwarmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to the \\nlast drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been \\nforced to sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with \\nin the town. Besides, she had bored them so with that letter \\n(you heard about her reading the letter). And all of a sud -\\nden those two switches fell from heaven! Her first act was \\nto order the carriage to be got out…. Not to speak of the Crime and Punishment \\x1800fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to \\nbe insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There \\nare instances of it with everyone; human beings in general, \\nindeed, greatly love to be insulted, have you noticed that? \\nBut it’s particularly so with women. One might even say it’s \\ntheir only amusement.’\\nAt one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walk -\\ning out and so finishing the interview. But some curiosity \\nand even a sort of prudence made him linger for a moment.\\n‘You are fond of fighting?’ he asked carelessly.\\n‘No, not very,’ Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. ‘And Marfa \\nPetrovna and I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmo -\\nniously, and she was always pleased with me. I only used \\nthe whip twice in all our seven years (not counting a third \\noccasion of a very ambiguous character). The first time, \\ntwo months after our marriage, immediately after we ar -\\nrived in the country, and the last time was that of which we \\nare speaking. Did you suppose I was such a monster, such \\na reactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! By the way, do \\nyou remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, \\nin those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve for -\\ngotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the \\npapers, for having thrashed a German woman in the rail -\\nway train. You remember? It was in those days, that very \\nyear I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the Age’ took place \\n(you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading, you \\nremember?

No one looked at the subject from that point of \\nview then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I as -\\nsure you.’\\nAfter saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh \\nagain. Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a \\nfirm purpose in his mind and able to keep it to himself.\\n‘I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?’ he \\nasked.\\n‘Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my be -\\ning such an adaptable man?’\\n‘No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a \\nman.’\\n‘Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your ques -\\ntions?

You are, as \\nthey say, ‘not without connections.’ What can you want \\nwith me, then, unless you’ve some special object?’\\n‘That’s true that I have friends here,’ Svidrigaïlov admit -\\nted, not replying to the chief point. ‘I’ve met some already. \\nI’ve been lounging about for the last three days, and I’ve \\nseen them, or they’ve seen me. That’s a matter of course. I \\nam well dressed and reckoned not a poor man; the emanci -\\npation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property consists \\nchiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not \\nfallen off; but … I am not going to see them, I was sick of \\nthem long ago. I’ve been here three days and have called on \\nno one…. What a town it is! How has it come into existence \\namong us, tell me that? A town of officials and students of \\nall sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t notice when I was \\nhere eight years ago, kicking up my heels…. My only hope \\nnow is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!’\\n‘Anatomy?’\\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, \\nindeed, maybe —well, all that can go on without me,’ he \\nwent on, again without noticing the question. ‘Besides, who \\nwants to be a card-sharper?’\\n‘Why, have you been a card-sharper then?’\\n‘How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, \\nmen of the best society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. \\nAnd all men of breeding, you know, poets, men of property. \\nAnd indeed as a rule in our Russian society the best manners \\nare found among those who’ve been thrashed, have you no -\\nticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get into \\nprison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Ne -\\nzhin. Then Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with \\nhim and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces (I \\nowed seventy thousand). We were united in lawful wedlock \\nand she bore me off into the country like a treasure. You \\nknow she was five years older than I. She was very fond of \\nme. For seven years I never left the country. And, take note, \\nthat all my life she held a document over me, the IOU for \\nthirty thousand roubles, so if I were to elect to be restive \\nabout anything I should be trapped at once! And she would \\nhave done it! Women find nothing incompatible in that.’\\n‘If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the \\nslip?’\\n‘I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document \\nrestrained me. I didn’t want to go anywhere else. Mar -\\nfa Petrovna herself invited me to go abroad, seeing I was \\nbored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always felt sick \\nthere. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18sea—you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most \\nrevolting is that one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. \\nHere at least one blames others for everything and excuses \\noneself. I should have gone perhaps on an expedition to the \\nNorth Pole, because j’ai le vin mauvais  and hate drinking, \\nand there’s nothing left but wine. I have tried it. But, I say, \\nI’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon next Sun -\\nday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers \\nat a fee. Is it true?’\\n‘Why, would you go up?’\\n‘I … No, oh, no,’ muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to \\nbe deep in thought.\\n‘What does he mean? Is he in earnest?’ Raskolnikov won -\\ndered.\\n‘No, the document didn’t restrain me,’ Svidrigaïlov went \\non, meditatively. ‘It was my own doing, not leaving the \\ncountry, and nearly a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back \\nthe document on my name- day and made me a present of \\na considerable sum of money, too. She had a fortune, you \\nknow. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’— that \\nwas actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? \\nBut do you know I managed the estate quite decently, they \\nknow me in the neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Mar -\\nfa Petrovna at first approved, but afterwards she was afraid \\nof my over-studying.’\\n‘You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?’\\n‘Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the \\nway, do you believe in ghosts?’\\n‘What ghosts?’\\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Why, ordinary ghosts.’\\n‘Do you believe in them?’\\n‘Perhaps not, pour vous plaire …. I wouldn’t say no ex -\\nactly.’\\n‘Do you see them, then?’\\nSvidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.\\n‘Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,’ he said, twisting \\nhis mouth into a strange smile.\\n‘How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?’\\n‘She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day \\nof the funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day \\nbefore I left to come here.

And if you could make a \\ngood choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happi -\\nness or hers, you will only be a laughing-stock to all good \\npeople.’ Then she went out and her train seemed to rustle. \\nIsn’t it nonsense, eh?’\\n‘But perhaps you are telling lies?’ Raskolnikov put in.\\n‘I rarely lie,’ answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, appar -\\nently not noticing the rudeness of the question.\\n‘And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?’\\n‘Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six \\nyears ago. I had a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called \\nout forgetting ‘Filka, my pipe!’ He came in and went to the \\ncupboard where my pipes were. I sat still and thought ‘he \\nis doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a violent quarrel \\njust before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole in Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and \\nwent out, and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petro -\\nvna at the time. I wanted to have a service sung for him, but \\nI was ashamed.’\\n‘You should go to a doctor.’\\n‘I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I \\ndon’t know what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong \\nas you are. I didn’t ask you whether you believe that ghosts \\nare seen, but whether you believe that they exist.’\\n‘No, I won’t believe it!’ Raskolnikov cried, with positive \\nanger.\\n‘What do people generally say?’ muttered Svidrigaïlov, as \\nthough speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his \\nhead. ‘They say, ‘You are ill, so what appears to you is only \\nunreal fantasy.’ But that’s not strictly logical. I agree that \\nghosts only appear to the sick, but that only proves that they \\nare unable to appear except to the sick, not that they don’t \\nexist.’\\n‘Nothing of the sort,’ Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\\n‘No? You don’t think so?’ Svidrigaïlov went on, looking \\nat him deliberately. ‘But what do you say to this argument \\n(help me with it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and frag -\\nments of other worlds, the beginning of them. A man in \\nhealth has, of course, no reason to see them, because he is \\nabove all a man of this earth and is bound for the sake of \\ncompleteness and order to live only in this life. But as soon \\nas one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the or -\\nganism is broken, one begins to realise the possibility of \\nanother world; and the more seriously ill one is, the closer \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combecomes one’s contact with that other world, so that as soon \\nas the man dies he steps straight into that world. I thought \\nof that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you could be -\\nlieve in that, too.’\\n‘I don’t believe in a future life,’ said Raskolnikov.\\nSvidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\\n‘And what if there are only spiders there, or something of \\nthat sort,’ he said suddenly.\\n‘He is a madman,’ thought Raskolnikov.\\n‘We always imagine eternity as something beyond our \\nconception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? \\nInstead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath \\nhouse in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every \\ncorner, and that’s all eternity is? I sometimes fancy it like \\nthat.’\\n‘Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more \\ncomforting than that?’ Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of \\nanguish.\\n‘Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and \\ndo you know it’s what I would certainly have made it,’ an -\\nswered Svidrigaïlov, with a vague smile.\\nThis horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskol -\\nnikov.

I am in a hurry, I want to \\ngo out …’\\n‘With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and de -\\ntermining on a certain … journey, I should like to make \\nsome necessary preliminary arrangements. I left my chil -\\ndren with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have \\nno need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, \\ntoo! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me \\na year ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just com -\\ning to the point. Before the journey which may come off, \\nI want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It’s not that I detest him \\nso much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa \\nPetrovna when I learned that she had dished up this mar -Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18riage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your \\nmediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to \\nher that in the first place she will never gain anything but \\nharm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all \\npast unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand \\nroubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture \\nto which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could \\nsee the way to it.’\\n‘You are certainly mad,’ cried Raskolnikov not so much \\nangered as astonished. ‘How dare you talk like that!’\\n‘I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, \\nthough I am not rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly \\nfree; I have absolutely no need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna \\ndoes not accept it, I shall waste it in some more foolish way. \\nThat’s the first thing. Secondly, my conscience is perfect -\\nly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive. You may \\nnot believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you \\nwill know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, \\nwhom I greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, \\nand so, sincerely regretting it, I want—not to compensate, \\nnot to repay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do \\nsomething to her advantage, to show that I am not, after all, \\nprivileged to do nothing but harm. If there were a millionth \\nfraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not have made \\nit so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thou -\\nsand only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I \\nmay, perhaps, very soon marry a young lady, and that alone \\nought to prevent suspicion of any design on Avdotya Ro -\\nmanovna. In conclusion, let me say that in marrying Mr. \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comLuzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from an -\\nother man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it \\nover coolly and quietly.’\\nSvidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as \\nhe was saying this.\\n‘I beg you to say no more,’ said Raskolnikov. ‘In any case \\nthis is unpardonable impertinence.’\\n‘Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm \\nto his neighbour in this world, and is prevented from do -\\ning the tiniest bit of good by trivial conventional formalities. \\nThat’s absurd. If I died, for instance, and left that sum to \\nyour sister in my will, surely she wouldn’t refuse it?’\\n‘Very likely she would.’\\n‘Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though \\nten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. \\nIn any case I beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya \\nRomanovna.’\\n‘No, I won’t.’\\n‘In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to \\ntry and see her myself and worry her by doing so.’\\n‘And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?’\\n‘I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much \\nto see her once more.’\\n‘Don’t hope for it.’\\n‘I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may be -\\ncome better friends.’\\n‘You think we may become friends?’\\n‘And why not?’ Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up \\nand took his hat. ‘I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18I came here without reckoning on it … though I was very \\nmuch struck by your face this morning.’\\n‘Where did you see me this morning?’ Raskolnikov asked \\nuneasily.\\n‘I saw you by chance….

I am not \\nintrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and \\nI never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a \\ndistant relation of mine, and I could write about Rapha -\\nel’s Madonna  in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left  \\nMarfa Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the \\nnight at Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old \\ndays, and I may go up in a balloon with Berg, perhaps.’\\n‘Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may \\nI ask?’\\n‘What travels?’\\n‘Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.’\\n‘A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s \\na wide subject…. if only you knew what you are asking,’ he \\nadded, and gave a sudden, loud, short laugh. ‘Perhaps I’ll \\nget married instead of the journey. They’re making a match \\nfor me.’\\n‘Here?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘How have you had time for that?’\\n‘But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. \\nI earnestly beg it.

I don’t understand you.’\\n‘Well, you all say,’ Raskolnikov went on, twisting his \\nmouth into a smile, ‘that I am mad. I thought just now that \\nperhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom.’\\n‘What do you mean?’\\n‘Why, who can tell?

Razumihin thought a min -\\nute.\\n‘Now let me tell you my story,’ he began, ‘I came to you, \\nyou were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to \\nPorfiry’s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but \\nit was no use. I couldn’t speak in the right way. They don’t \\nseem to understand and can’t understand, but are not a bit \\nashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking \\nto him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked \\naway. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him \\nas a cousin I’d brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed \\nand came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov \\nI didn’t say a word. But, you see, I thought I’d made a mess \\nof it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger or \\nanything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang \\nfor them. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if \\nI were in your place I’d mystify them more than ever. How \\nashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash \\nthem afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!’\\n‘To be sure,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘But what will you \\nsay to-morrow?’ he thought to himself. Strange to say, till \\nthat moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what \\nRazumihin would think when he knew. As he thought it, \\nRaskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his vis -\\nit to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had \\ncome and gone since then.\\nIn the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived \\npunctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so \\nthat all three went in together without greeting or look -\\ning at one another. The young men walked in first, while \\nPyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the \\npassage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came \\nforward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was \\nwelcoming her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and \\nquite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the \\nladies. He looked, however, as though he were a little put \\nout and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to \\nmake them all sit down at the round table where a samovar \\nwas boiling. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another \\non opposite sides of the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov \\nwere facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\\nA moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch delib -\\nerately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent \\nand blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt \\nhimself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an ex -\\nplanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to \\nkeep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two \\nladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the \\ngravity of the position. But he could not bring himself to \\ndo this. Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he \\nwanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly \\ndisobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case \\nit was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to \\npunish them and there would always be time for that.\\n‘I trust you had a favourable journey,’ he inquired offi -\\ncially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.’\\n‘I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not \\nover-fatigued either?’\\n‘I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great \\nstrain for mother,’ answered Dounia.\\n‘That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible \\nlength. ‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country…. In \\nspite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yes -\\nterday. But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?’\\n‘Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheart -\\nening,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with \\npeculiar intonation, ‘and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been \\nsent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,’ \\nshe added, introducing him to Luzhin.\\n‘I had the pleasure … yesterday,’ muttered Pyotr Petro -\\nvitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he \\nscowled and was silent.\\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on \\nthe surface very polite in society, who make a great point of \\npunctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in any -\\nthing, are completely disconcerted, and become more like \\nsacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again \\nall was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya \\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too \\nsoon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna was anxious again.\\n‘Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?’ she began hav -\\ning recourse to her leading item of conversation.\\n‘To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, \\nand I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that \\nArkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Peters -\\nburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So at least I have \\nexcellent authority for believing.’\\n‘To Petersburg? here?’ Dounia asked in alarm and looked \\nat her mother.\\n‘Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, \\nhaving in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the cir -\\ncumstances preceding it.’\\n‘Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even \\nhere?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhave any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are \\nyourselves desirous of getting into communication with \\nhim. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discover -\\ning where he is lodging.’\\n‘Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright \\nyou have given me,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ‘I’ve \\nonly seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! \\nI am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s \\ndeath.’\\n‘It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise \\ninformation. I do not dispute that he may have contribut -\\ned to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, \\nso to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and \\nmoral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement \\nwith you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and pre -'), Document(page_content='over-fatigued either?’\\n‘I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great \\nstrain for mother,’ answered Dounia.\\n‘That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible \\nlength. ‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country….

Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,’ \\nshe added, introducing him to Luzhin.\\n‘I had the pleasure … yesterday,’ muttered Pyotr Petro -\\nvitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he \\nscowled and was silent.\\nPyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on \\nthe surface very polite in society, who make a great point of \\npunctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in any -\\nthing, are completely disconcerted, and become more like \\nsacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again \\nall was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya \\nRomanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too \\nsoon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna was anxious again.\\n‘Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?’ she began hav -\\ning recourse to her leading item of conversation.\\n‘To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, \\nand I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that \\nArkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov set off in haste for Peters -\\nburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So at least I have \\nexcellent authority for believing.’\\n‘To Petersburg? here?’ Dounia asked in alarm and looked \\nat her mother.\\n‘Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, \\nhaving in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the cir -\\ncumstances preceding it.’\\n‘Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even \\nhere?’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\n‘I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhave any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are \\nyourselves desirous of getting into communication with \\nhim. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discover -\\ning where he is lodging.’\\n‘Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright \\nyou have given me,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ‘I’ve \\nonly seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! \\nI am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna’s \\ndeath.’\\n‘It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise \\ninformation. I do not dispute that he may have contribut -\\ned to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, \\nso to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and \\nmoral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement \\nwith you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and pre -\\ncisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to \\nme within a very short period; but no doubt here in Peters -\\nburg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at \\nonce into his old ways. He is the most depraved, and abject -\\nly vicious specimen of that class of men. I have considerable \\nreason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfor -\\ntunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight \\nyears ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely \\nby her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving \\nan element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which \\nhe might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed \\nup. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to know.’\\n‘Good heavens!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskol -\\nnikov listened attentively.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have \\ngood evidence of this?’ Dounia asked sternly and emphati -\\ncally.\\n‘I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. \\nI must observe that from the legal point of view the case was \\nfar from clear. There was, and I believe still is, living here \\na woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums \\nof money at interest, and did other commissions, and with \\nthis woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close and mys -\\nterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living \\nwith her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not \\nmore than fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged \\nher every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly. One day \\nthe girl was found hanging in the garret. At the inquest the \\nverdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings the matter \\nended, but, later on, information was given that the child \\nhad been … cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this \\nwas not clearly established, the information was given by \\nanother German woman of loose character whose word \\ncould not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the \\npolice, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and exertions; it \\ndid not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very signifi -\\ncant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when \\nyou were with them the story of the servant Philip who died \\nof ill treatment he received six years ago, before the aboli -\\ntion of serfdom.’\\n‘I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged him -\\nself.’\\n‘Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps dis -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.composed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and \\nseverity of Mr. Svidrigaïlov.’\\n‘I don’t know that,’ answered Dounia, dryly. ‘I only heard \\na queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort \\nof domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, ‘he read \\nhimself silly,’ and that he hanged himself partly on account \\nof Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not his blows. \\nWhen I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they \\nwere actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame \\nhim for Philip’s death.’\\n‘I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed \\nto undertake his defence all of a sudden,’ Luzhin observed, \\ntwisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, ‘there’s no doubt \\nthat he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are \\nconcerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so \\nstrangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to \\nbe of service to you and your mother with my advice, in \\nview of the renewed efforts which may certainly be antici -\\npated from him. For my part it’s my firm conviction, that he \\nwill end in a debtor’s prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not \\nthe slightest intention of settling anything substantial on \\nhim, having regard for his children’s interests, and, if she \\nleft him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, \\nsomething insignificant and ephemeral, which would not \\nlast a year for a man of his habits.’\\n‘Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,’ said Dounia, ‘say no more of \\nMr. Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.’\\n‘He has just been to see me,’ said Raskolnikov, breaking \\nhis silence for the first time.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to \\nhim. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused.\\n‘An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, \\nwaked me, and introduced himself,’ Raskolnikov continued. \\n‘He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we \\nshall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, \\nDounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to \\nassist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me \\nabout it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa \\nPetrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dou -\\nnia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.’\\n‘Thank God!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing \\nherself. ‘Pray for her soul, Dounia!’\\n‘It’s a fact!’ broke from Luzhin.\\n‘Tell us, what more?’ Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\\n‘Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was \\nleft to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he \\nwas staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don’t \\nknow, I didn’t ask….’\\n‘But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?’ \\ncried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. ‘Did he tell you?’\\n‘Yes.’\\n‘What was it?’\\n‘I’ll tell you afterwards.’\\nRaskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention \\nto his tea.\\nPyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\\n‘I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I \\nshall not be in your way,’ he added with an air of some pique \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand he began getting up.\\n‘Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,’ said Dounia, ‘you intended \\nto spend the evening.

This conviction \\nwas strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the \\npoint of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up \\nfrom insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, \\nhad the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, \\nand sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in \\nthe glass.

Him, and him \\nalone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he \\nwent downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps \\nnot utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, \\nall might ‘very well indeed’ be set right again.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18Chapter III\\nThe fact was that up to the last moment he had never ex -\\npected such an ending; he had been overbearing to the \\nlast degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defence -\\nless women could escape from his control. This conviction \\nwas strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to the \\npoint of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up \\nfrom insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, \\nhad the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, \\nand sometimes even gloated in solitude over his image in \\nthe glass. But what he loved and valued above all was the \\nmoney he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of de -\\nvices: that money made him the equal of all who had been \\nhis superiors.\\nWhen he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had de -\\ncided to take her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had \\nspoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed, felt genuine -\\nly indignant at such ‘black ingratitude.’ And yet, when he \\nmade Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the ground -\\nlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere \\ncontradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbe -\\nlieved by all the townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a \\ndefence. And he would not have denied that he knew all that \\nat the time. Yet he still thought highly of his own resolution \\nin lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comheroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret \\nfeeling he cherished and admired, and he could not under -\\nstand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called \\non Raskolnikov with the feelings of a benefactor who is \\nabout to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear agree -\\nable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered \\nhimself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.\\nDounia was simply essential to him; to do without her \\nwas unthinkable.

How \\nmany scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imag -\\nined on this seductive and playful theme, when his work \\nwas over! And, behold, the dream of so many years was \\nall but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Ro -\\nmanovna had impressed him; her helpless position had been \\na great allurement; in her he had found even more than he \\ndreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of \\neducation and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), \\nand this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for \\nhis heroic condescension, and would humble herself in the \\ndust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded \\npower over her! … Not long before, he had, too, after long \\nreflection and hesitation, made an important change in his Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18career and was now entering on a wider circle of business. \\nWith this change his cherished dreams of rising into a high -\\ner class of society seemed likely to be realised…. He was, in \\nfact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He knew \\nthat women could do a very great deal. The fascination of a \\ncharming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make \\nhis way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to \\nhim, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything \\nwas in ruins! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like \\na clap of thunder; it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity. \\nHe had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time \\nto speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried away \\n—and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did \\nlove Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his \\ndreams—and all at once! No! The next day, the very next \\nday, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above \\nall he must crush that conceited milksop who was the cause \\nof it all. With a sick feeling he could not help recalling Ra -\\nzumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; \\nas though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! \\nThe man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov…. He \\nhad, in short, a great deal to attend to….\\n*****\\n‘No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!’ said Dounia, \\nkissing and embracing her mother. ‘I was tempted by his \\nmoney, but on my honour, brother, I had no idea he was \\nsuch a base man. If I had seen through him before, nothing \\nwould have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!’\\n‘God has delivered us!

Only now and then Dounia turned white and \\nfrowned, remembering what had passed. Pulcheria Alexan -\\ndrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad: she had \\nonly that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible \\nmisfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare \\nto express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as \\nthough a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. Now he had the \\nright to devote his life to them, to serve them…. Anything \\nmight happen now! But he felt afraid to think of further \\npossibilities and dared not let his imagination range. But \\nRaskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and \\nindifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on get -\\nting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at \\nwhat had happened. Dounia could not help thinking that \\nhe was still angry with her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna \\nwatched him timidly.\\n‘What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?’ said Dounia, ap -\\nproaching him.\\n‘Yes, yes!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\\nRaskolnikov raised his head.\\n‘He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles \\nand he desires to see you once in my presence.’\\n‘See her!

It all flashed into my head this \\nmorning, before anything had happened … I tell you what; \\nI have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most ac -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180commodating and respectable old man). This uncle has got \\na capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his pension \\nand has no need of that money. For the last two years he has \\nbeen bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six \\nper cent. interest. I know what that means; he simply wants \\nto help me.

Then you lend me \\nanother thousand of your three and we have enough for a \\nstart, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going \\nto do?’\\nThen Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he \\nexplained at length that almost all our publishers and book -\\nsellers know nothing at all of what they are selling, and for \\nthat reason they are usually bad publishers, and that any \\ndecent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, some -\\ntimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been \\ndreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years \\nhe had been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three \\nEuropean languages well, though he had told Raskolnikov \\nsix days before that he was ‘schwach’ in German with an \\nobject of persuading him to take half his translation and \\nhalf the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and Raskol -\\nnikov knew he was lying.\\n‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have \\none of the chief means of success—money of our own!’ cried \\nRazumihin warmly. ‘Of course there will be a lot of work, \\nbut we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion…. \\nYou get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And the \\ngreat point of the business is that we shall know just what \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, \\nlearning all at once. I can be of use because I have experi -\\nence. For nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among \\nthe publishers, and now I know every detail of their busi -\\nness. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And \\nwhy, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know—and \\nI kept the secret—two or three books which one might get \\na hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and \\npublishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for \\nthe very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I \\nwere to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate—they are \\nsuch blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, pa -\\nper, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll \\nbegin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case it will \\nget us our living and we shall get back our capital.’\\nDounia’s eyes shone.\\n‘I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!’ she said.\\n‘I know nothing about it, of course,’ put in Pulcheria Al -\\nexandrovna, ‘it may be a good idea, but again God knows. \\nIt’s new and untried. Of course, we must remain here at \\nleast for a time.’ She looked at Rodya.\\n‘What do you think, brother?’ said Dounia.\\n‘I think he’s got a very good idea,’ he answered. ‘Of \\ncourse, it’s too soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we \\ncertainly might bring out five or six books and be sure of \\nsuccess. I know of one book myself which would be sure to \\ngo well. And as for his being able to manage it, there’s no \\ndoubt about that either. He knows the business…. But we \\ncan talk it over later….’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘Hurrah!’ cried Razumihin. ‘Now, stay, there’s a flat here \\nin this house, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special \\nflat apart, not communicating with these lodgings. It’s fur -\\nnished, rent moderate, three rooms. Suppose you take them \\nto begin with. I’ll pawn your watch to-morrow and bring \\nyou the money, and everything can be arranged then. You \\ncan all three live together, and Rodya will be with you.

In fact from that evening \\nRazumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18Chapter IV\\nRaskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank \\nwhere Sonia lived. It was an old green house of three \\nstoreys. He found the porter and obtained from him vague \\ndirections as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor. \\nHaving found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance \\nto the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second \\nfloor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole \\nsecond storey over the yard. While he was wandering in the \\ndarkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, \\na door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took \\nhold of it.\\n‘Who is there?’ a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\\n‘It’s I … come to see you,’ answered Raskolnikov and he \\nwalked into the tiny entry.\\nOn a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper \\ncandlestick.\\n‘It’s you! Good heavens!’ cried Sonia weakly, and she \\nstood rooted to the spot.\\n‘Which is your room? This way?’ and Raskolnikov, trying \\nnot to look at her, hastened in.\\nA minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set \\ndown the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood \\nbefore him inexpressibly agitated and apparently fright -\\nened by his unexpected visit. The colour rushed suddenly \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto her pale face and tears came into her eyes … She felt sick \\nand ashamed and happy, too…. Raskolnikov turned away \\nquickly and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the \\nroom in a rapid glance.\\nIt was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only \\none let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door \\nled in the wall on the left. In the opposite side on the right \\nhand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led \\nto the next flat, which formed a separate lodging. Sonia’s \\nroom looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle \\nand this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three \\nwindows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one \\ncorner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see \\nin it without very strong light. The other corner was dis -\\nproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any furniture \\nin the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, \\nbeside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table cov -\\nered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the \\ndoor into the other flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by \\nthe table. On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood \\na small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, \\nlost in a desert. That was all there was in the room. The \\nyellow, scratched and shabby wall- paper was black in the \\ncorners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the \\nwinter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead \\nhad no curtain.\\nSonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so atten -\\ntively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and \\neven began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies.\\n‘I am late…. It’s eleven, isn’t it?’ he asked, still not lifting \\nhis eyes.\\n‘Yes,’ muttered Sonia, ‘oh yes, it is,’ she added, hastily, as \\nthough in that lay her means of escape. ‘My landlady’s clock \\nhas just struck … I heard it myself….’\\n‘I’ve come to you for the last time,’ Raskolnikov went on \\ngloomily, although this was the first time. ‘I may perhaps \\nnot see you again …’\\n‘Are you … going away?’\\n‘I don’t know … to-morrow….’\\n‘Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-mor -\\nrow?’ Sonia’s voice shook.\\n‘I don’t know.

He still paced up and down the \\nroom in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to her; \\nhis eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her shoulders \\nand looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, \\nfeverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he \\nbent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her \\nfoot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman.

And in her presence?’ cried \\nSonia, frightened. ‘Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m \\n… dishonourable….

It would be better, a thousand \\ntimes better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!’\\n‘But what would become of them?’ Sonia asked faintly, \\ngazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming sur -\\nprised at his suggestion.\\nRaskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her \\nface; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps \\nmany times, and earnestly she had thought out in her de -\\nspair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely \\nwondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the \\ncruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and \\nhis peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not \\nnoticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw \\nhow monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shame -\\nful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. \\n‘What, what,’ he thought, ‘could hitherto have hindered her \\nfrom putting an end to it?’ Only then he realised what those \\npoor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Kat -\\nerina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her \\nconsumption, meant for Sonia.\\nBut, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her \\ncharacter and the amount of education she had after all re -\\nceived, she could not in any case remain so.

And you won’t go to your father’s fu -\\nneral to-morrow?’\\n‘Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too … I had a re -\\nquiem service.’\\n‘For whom?’\\n‘For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.’\\nHis nerves were more and more strained. His head be -\\ngan to go round.\\n‘Were you friends with Lizaveta?’\\n‘Yes…. She was good … she used to come … not often … \\nshe couldn’t…. We used to read together and … talk. She \\nwill see God.’\\nThe last phrase sounded strange in his ears.

It’s infectious!’\\n‘Read!’ he cried irritably and insistently.\\nSonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hard -\\nly dared to read to him.

I want you to,’ he persisted. ‘You used to read to \\nLizaveta.’\\nSonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands \\nwere shaking, her voice failed her.

A card was fixed on the gate \\nand a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertis -\\ning it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room’s \\nbeing uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had \\nbeen standing, listening at the door of the empty room. \\nWhen Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a mo -\\nment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the \\nempty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the \\ndoor that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck \\nhim as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly en -\\njoyed it—so much so that he brought a chair that he might \\nnot in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure \\nthe inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might lis -\\nten in comfort.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180Chapter V\\nWhen next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskol -\\nnikov went into the department of the investigation \\nof criminal causes and sent his name in to Porfiry Petro -\\nvitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long: it was \\nat least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had ex -\\npected that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in \\nthe waiting- room, and people, who apparently had nothing \\nto do with him, were continually passing to and fro before \\nhim. In the next room which looked like an office, several \\nclerks were sitting writing and obviously they had no no -\\ntion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily \\nand suspiciously about him to see whether there was not \\nsome guard, some mysterious watch being kept on him to \\nprevent his escape. But there was nothing of the sort: he \\nsaw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty details, then \\nother people, no one seemed to have any concern with him. \\nHe might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew \\nstronger in him that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that \\nphantom sprung out of the earth, had seen everything, they \\nwould not have let him stand and wait like that. And would \\nthey have waited till he elected to appear at eleven? Either \\nthe man had not yet given information, or … or simply he \\nknew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have \\nseen anything?) and so all that had happened to him the \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comday before was again a phantom exaggerated by his sick and \\noverstrained imagination. This conjecture had begun to \\ngrow strong the day before, in the midst of all his alarm and \\ndespair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh \\nconflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling—\\nand he felt a rush of indignation at the thought that he was \\ntrembling with fear at facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. \\nWhat he dreaded above all was meeting that man again; he \\nhated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred and was \\nafraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was \\nsuch that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go \\nin with a cold and arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to \\nkeep as silent as possible, to watch and listen and for once at \\nleast to control his overstrained nerves. At that moment he \\nwas summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\\nHe found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His \\nstudy was a room neither large nor small, furnished with \\na large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered \\nin checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner \\nand several chairs—all government furniture, of polished \\nyellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door, be -\\nyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s \\nentrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by \\nwhich he had come in and they remained alone. He met his \\nvisitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, \\nand it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw \\nsigns of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had \\nbeen thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something \\nvery secret.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are … in our domain’ … \\nbegan Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. ‘Come, sit \\ndown, old man … or perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘my \\ndear fellow’ and ‘old man!’—/tout court? Please don’t think \\nit too familiar…. Here, on the sofa.’\\nRaskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. \\n‘In our domain,’ the apologies for familiarity, the French \\nphrase tout court  were all characteristic signs.\\n‘He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me \\none—he drew it back in time,’ struck him suspiciously. Both \\nwere watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as \\nlightning they looked away.\\n‘I brought you this paper … about the watch. Here it is. Is \\nit all right or shall I copy it again?’\\n‘What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,’ \\nPorfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had \\nsaid it he took the paper and looked at it. ‘Yes, it’s all right. \\nNothing more is needed,’ he declared with the same rapid -\\nity and he laid the paper on the table.\\nA minute later when he was talking of something else he \\ntook it from the table and put it on his bureau.\\n‘I believe you said yesterday you would like to question \\nme … formally … about my acquaintance with the mur -\\ndered woman?’ Raskolnikov was beginning again. ‘Why \\ndid I put in ‘I believe’’ passed through his mind in a flash. \\n‘Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘ I believe ’?’ came \\nin a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his uneasiness at \\nthe mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the first \\nlooks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand that this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were \\nquivering, his emotion was increasing. ‘It’s bad, it’s bad! I \\nshall say too much again.’\\n‘Yes, yes, yes!

Isn’t that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I \\nfancy, in all the manuals of the art?’\\n‘Yes, yes…. Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke \\nabout government quarters … eh?’\\nAnd as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his \\neyes and winked; a good-humoured, crafty look passed \\nover his face. The wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed \\nout, his eyes contracted, his features broadened and he sud -\\ndenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all \\nover and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter \\nforced himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that \\nhe was laughing, broke into such a guffaw that he turned \\nalmost crimson, Raskolnikov’s repulsion overcame all pre -\\ncaution; he left off laughing, scowled and stared with hatred \\nat Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his intention -\\nally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution \\non both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be \\nlaughing in his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed \\nat the annoyance with which the visitor received it. The lat -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comter fact was very significant in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw \\nthat Porfiry Petrovitch had not been embarrassed just be -\\nfore either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps fallen into \\na trap; that there must be something, some motive here un -\\nknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness \\nand in another moment would break upon him …\\nHe went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat \\nand took his cap.\\n‘Porfiry Petrovitch,’ he began resolutely, though with \\nconsiderable irritation, ‘yesterday you expressed a desire \\nthat I should come to you for some inquiries’ (he laid spe -\\ncial stress on the word ‘inquiries’). ‘I have come and if you \\nhave anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow me to with -\\ndraw. I have no time to spare…. I have to be at the funeral \\nof that man who was run over, of whom you … know also,’ \\nhe added, feeling angry at once at having made this addi -\\ntion and more irritated at his anger. ‘I am sick of it all, do \\nyou hear? and have long been. It’s partly what made me ill. \\nIn short,’ he shouted, feeling that the phrase about his ill -\\nness was still more out of place, ‘in short, kindly examine \\nme or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so \\nin the proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, \\nand so meanwhile, good-bye, as we have evidently nothing \\nto keep us now.’\\n‘Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I ques -\\ntion you about?’ cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change \\nof tone, instantly leaving off laughing. ‘Please don’t disturb \\nyourself,’ he began fidgeting from place to place and fussily \\nmaking Raskolnikov sit down. ‘There’s no hurry, there’s no Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18hurry, it’s all nonsense.

He \\nwas almost running about the room, moving his fat little \\nlegs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his \\nright hand behind his back, while with his left making ges -\\nticulations that were extraordinarily incongruous with his \\nwords.

Some of these elaborate psychological \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commethods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if \\none adheres too closely to the forms. Yes … I am talking of \\nforms again. Well, if I recognise, or more strictly speaking, \\nif I suspect someone or other to be a criminal in any case \\nentrusted to me … you’re reading for the law, of course, Ro -\\ndion Romanovitch?’\\n‘Yes, I was …’\\n‘Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future—though \\ndon’t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the ar -\\nticles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to \\nstate it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, \\nwhy, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I \\nhad evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for \\ninstance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in \\nquite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let \\nhim walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t \\nquite understand, so I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put \\nhim in prison too soon, I may very likely give him, so to \\nspeak, moral support, he-he! You’re laughing?’\\nRaskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with \\ncompressed lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petro -\\nvitch’s.\\n‘Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men \\nare so different. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evi -\\ndence. But evidence, you know, can generally be taken two \\nways. I am an examining lawyer and a weak man, I confess \\nit. I should like to make a proof, so to say, mathematical -\\nly clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence such as \\ntwice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof! Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180And if I shut him up too soon—even though I might be con -\\nvinced he was the man, I should very likely be depriving \\nmyself of the means of getting further evidence against him. \\nAnd how? By giving him, so to speak, a definite position, I \\nshall put him out of suspense and set his mind at rest, so \\nthat he will retreat into his shell. They say that at Sevastopol, \\nsoon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright \\nthat the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at \\nonce. But when they saw that the enemy preferred a regular \\nsiege, they were delighted, I am told and reassured, for the \\nthing would drag on for two months at least. You’re laugh -\\ning, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re right, too. \\nYou’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I admit. \\nBut you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, \\nthe general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules \\nare intended, for which they are calculated and laid down \\nin books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, \\nevery crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at \\nonce becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a \\ncase unlike any that’s gone before.

You’re ill!’ and he was running to the door to call \\nfor some when he found a decanter of water in the corner. \\n‘Come, drink a little,’ he whispered, rushing up to him with \\nthe decanter. ‘It will be sure to do you good.’\\nPorfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural \\nthat Raskolnikov was silent and began looking at him with \\nwild curiosity. He did not take the water, however.\\n‘Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive your -\\nself out of your mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some \\nwater, do drink a little.’\\nHe forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it \\nmechanically to his lips, but set it on the table again with \\ndisgust.\\n‘Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your ill -\\nness again, my dear fellow,’ Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with \\nfriendly sympathy, though he still looked rather discon -\\ncerted. ‘Good heavens, you must take more care of yourself! \\nDmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me yesterday—I \\nknow, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they \\nmade of it! … Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d \\nbeen. We dined and he talked and talked away, and I could \\nonly throw up my hands in despair! Did he come from you? \\nBut do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit down!’\\n‘No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he \\nwent,’ Raskolnikov answered sharply.\\n‘You knew?’\\n‘I knew. What of it?’\\n‘Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than \\nthat about you; I know about everything. I know how you \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwent to take a flat  at night when it was dark and how you \\nrang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the work -\\nmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, \\nI understand your state of mind at that time … but you’ll \\ndrive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your \\nhead! You’re full of generous indignation at the wrongs \\nyou’ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police \\nofficers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force \\nthem to speak out and make an end of it all, because you \\nare sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t \\nit? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way \\nyou’ll lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too good  \\na man for such a position, you must know that. You are ill \\nand he is good and your illness is infectious for him … I’ll \\ntell you about it when you are more yourself…. But do sit \\ndown, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you look shocking, do \\nsit down.’\\nRaskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was \\nhot all over. In amazement he listened with strained atten -\\ntion to Porfiry Petrovitch who still seemed frightened as he \\nlooked after him with friendly solicitude. But he did not be -\\nlieve a word he said, though he felt a strange inclination to \\nbelieve. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had ut -\\nterly overwhelmed him. ‘How can it be, he knows about the \\nflat then,’ he thought suddenly, ‘and he tells it me himself!’\\n‘Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exact -\\nly similar, a case of morbid psychology,’ Porfiry went on \\nquickly. ‘A man confessed to murder and how he kept it up! \\nIt was a regular hallucination; he brought forward facts, he Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but \\nonly partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when \\nhe knew that he had given the murderers the opportunity, \\nhe sank into dejection, it got on his mind and turned his \\nbrain, he began imagining things and he persuaded him -\\nself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court of \\nAppeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and \\nput under proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-\\ntut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into \\ndelirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, \\nto go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I’ve \\nstudied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man \\nis sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a \\nbelfry. Just the same with bell-ringing….

He can’t be, he can’t be.’ He rejected \\nthat idea, feeling to what a degree of fury it might drive him, \\nfeeling that that fury might drive him mad.\\n‘I was not delirious.

He \\nstared straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There \\nwas a determined gleam in his eyes; at the same time there \\nwas a deathly pallor in his face, as though he were being led \\nto the scaffold. His white lips were faintly twitching.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18He was dressed like a workman and was of medium \\nheight, very young, slim, his hair cut in round crop, with \\nthin spare features. The man whom he had thrust back fol -\\nlowed him into the room and succeeded in seizing him by \\nthe shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm \\naway.\\nSeveral persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. \\nSome of them tried to get in.

Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,’ Nikolay \\narticulated suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly \\nloudly.\\nFor ten seconds there was silence as though all had been \\nstruck dumb; even the warder stepped back, mechanically \\nretreated to the door, and stood immovable.\\n‘What is it?’ cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his \\nmomentary stupefaction.\\n‘I … am the murderer,’ repeated Nikolay, after a brief \\npause.\\n‘What … you … what … whom did you kill?’ Porfiry \\nPetrovitch was obviously bewildered.\\nNikolay again was silent for a moment.\\n‘Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I … \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comkilled … with an axe.

Porfiry Petrovitch stood \\nfor some moments as though meditating, but suddenly \\nroused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. \\nThey instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he looked \\ntowards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, star -\\ning wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped \\nshort, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again \\nat Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted \\nat the latter.\\n‘You’re in too great a hurry,’ he shouted at him, almost \\nangrily. ‘I didn’t ask you what came over you…. Speak, did \\nyou kill them?’\\n‘I am the murderer…. I want to give evidence,’ Nikolay \\npronounced.\\n‘Ach! What did you kill them with?’\\n‘An axe. I had it ready.’\\n‘Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?’\\nNikolay did not understand the question.\\n‘Did you do it alone?’\\n‘Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in \\nit.’\\n‘Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you \\nran downstairs like that at the time? The porters met you \\nboth!’\\n‘It was to put them off the scent … I ran after Mitka,’ \\nNikolay replied hurriedly, as though he had prepared the \\nanswer.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘I knew it!’ cried Porfiry, with vexation. ‘It’s not his own \\ntale he is telling,’ he muttered as though to himself, and \\nsuddenly his eyes rested on Raskolnikov again.\\nHe was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a \\nmoment he had forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken \\naback.\\n‘My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!’ he flew up to \\nhim, ‘this won’t do; I’m afraid you must go … it’s no good \\nyour staying … I will … you see, what a surprise! … Good-\\nbye!’\\nAnd taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\\n‘I suppose you didn’t expect it?’ said Raskolnikov who, \\nthough he had not yet fully grasped the situation, had re -\\ngained his courage.\\n‘You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your \\nhand is trembling! He-he!’\\n‘You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!’\\n‘Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.’\\nThey were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for \\nRaskolnikov to be gone.\\n‘And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to \\nme?’ Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\\n‘Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are \\nan ironical person! Come, till we meet!’\\n‘I believe we can say good-bye !’\\n‘That’s in God’s hands,’ muttered Porfiry, with an unnat -\\nural smile.\\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed \\nthat many people were looking at him. Among them he saw \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthe two porters from the house, whom he had invited that \\nnight to the police station. They stood there waiting. But \\nhe was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of \\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the \\nlatter running after him, out of breath.\\n‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in \\nGod’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some ques -\\ntions I shall have to ask you … so we shall meet again, shan’t \\nwe?’\\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\\n‘Shan’t we?’ he added again.\\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not \\nspeak out.\\n‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has \\njust passed … I lost my temper,’ began Raskolnikov, who \\nhad so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly in -\\nclined to display his coolness.\\n‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, al -\\nmost gleefully. ‘I myself, too … I have a wicked temper, I \\nadmit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we may \\nsee a great deal of one another.’\\n‘And will get to know each other through and through?’ \\nadded Raskolnikov.\\n‘Yes; know each other through and through,’ assented \\nPorfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking \\nearnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday \\nparty?’\\n‘To a funeral.’\\n‘Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get Crime and Punishment \\x1800well.’\\n‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, who \\nhad begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. ‘I \\nshould like to wish you success, but your office is such a \\ncomical one.’\\n‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but \\nhe seemed to prick up his ears at this.\\n‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing \\nthat poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he \\nconfessed! You must have been at him day and night, prov -\\ning to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has \\nconfessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are ly -\\ning,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s \\nnot your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a \\ncomical business!’\\n‘He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just \\nnow that it was not his own tale he was telling?’\\n‘How could I help noticing it!’\\n‘He-he! You are quick-witted.

Come, till we meet!’\\n‘I believe we can say good-bye !’\\n‘That’s in God’s hands,’ muttered Porfiry, with an unnat -\\nural smile.\\nAs he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed \\nthat many people were looking at him. Among them he saw \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthe two porters from the house, whom he had invited that \\nnight to the police station. They stood there waiting. But \\nhe was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of \\nPorfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the \\nlatter running after him, out of breath.\\n‘One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in \\nGod’s hands, but as a matter of form there are some ques -\\ntions I shall have to ask you … so we shall meet again, shan’t \\nwe?’\\nAnd Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\\n‘Shan’t we?’ he added again.\\nHe seemed to want to say something more, but could not \\nspeak out.\\n‘You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has \\njust passed … I lost my temper,’ began Raskolnikov, who \\nhad so far regained his courage that he felt irresistibly in -\\nclined to display his coolness.\\n‘Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,’ Porfiry replied, al -\\nmost gleefully. ‘I myself, too … I have a wicked temper, I \\nadmit it! But we shall meet again. If it’s God’s will, we may \\nsee a great deal of one another.’\\n‘And will get to know each other through and through?’ \\nadded Raskolnikov.\\n‘Yes; know each other through and through,’ assented \\nPorfiry Petrovitch, and he screwed up his eyes, looking \\nearnestly at Raskolnikov. ‘Now you’re going to a birthday \\nparty?’\\n‘To a funeral.’\\n‘Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get Crime and Punishment \\x1800well.’\\n‘I don’t know what to wish you,’ said Raskolnikov, who \\nhad begun to descend the stairs, but looked back again. ‘I \\nshould like to wish you success, but your office is such a \\ncomical one.’\\n‘Why comical?’ Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but \\nhe seemed to prick up his ears at this.\\n‘Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing \\nthat poor Nikolay psychologically, after your fashion, till he \\nconfessed! You must have been at him day and night, prov -\\ning to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has \\nconfessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are ly -\\ning,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s \\nnot your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a \\ncomical business!’\\n‘He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just \\nnow that it was not his own tale he was telling?’\\n‘How could I help noticing it!’\\n‘He-he! You are quick-witted.

They say that was the marked charac -\\nteristic of Gogol, among the writers.’\\n‘Yes, of Gogol.’\\n‘Yes, of Gogol…. I shall look forward to meeting you.’\\n‘So shall I.’\\nRaskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled \\nand bewildered that on getting home he sat for a quarter of \\nan hour on the sofa, trying to collect his thoughts. He did \\nnot attempt to think about Nikolay; he was stupefied; he \\x1801 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfelt that his confession was something inexplicable, amaz -\\ning—something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s \\nconfession was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact \\nwere clear to him at once, its falsehood could not fail to be \\ndiscovered, and then they would be after him again. Till \\nthen, at least, he was free and must do something for him -\\nself, for the danger was imminent.\\nBut how imminent? His position gradually became clear \\nto him. Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his \\nrecent scene with Porfiry, he could not help shuddering \\nagain with horror. Of course, he did not yet know all Por -\\nfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his calculations. But he \\nhad already partly shown his hand, and no one knew bet -\\nter than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s ‘lead’ had been \\nfor him. A little more and he might  have given himself away \\ncompletely, circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temper -\\nament and from the first glance seeing through him, Porfiry, \\nthough playing a bold game, was bound to win. There’s \\nno denying that Raskolnikov had compromised himself \\nseriously, but no facts  had come to light as yet; there was \\nnothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the po -\\nsition? Wasn’t he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying \\nto get at? Had he really some surprise prepared for him? \\nAnd what was it? Had he really been expecting something \\nor not? How would they have parted if it had not been for \\nthe unexpected appearance of Nikolay?\\nPorfiry had shown almost all his cards—of course, he \\nhad risked something in showing them—and if he had re -\\nally had anything up his sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18would have shown that, too. What was that ‘surprise’? Was \\nit a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have concealed \\nanything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His yes -\\nterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he \\nto-day? If Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be con -\\nnected with him….\\nHe sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his \\nface hidden in his hands. He was still shivering nervously. \\nAt last he got up, took his cap, thought a minute, and went \\nto the door.\\nHe had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, \\nhe might consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden \\nsense almost of joy; he wanted to make haste to Katerina \\nIvanovna’s. He would be too late for the funeral, of course, \\nbut he would be in time for the memorial dinner, and there \\nat once he would see Sonia.\\nHe stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile \\ncame for a moment on to his lips.\\n‘To-day! To-day,’ he repeated to himself. ‘Yes, to-day! So \\nit must be….’\\nBut as he was about to open the door, it began opening of \\nitself. He started and moved back. The door opened gently \\nand slowly, and there suddenly appeared a figure—yester -\\nday’s visitor from underground .\\nThe man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov \\nwithout speaking, and took a step forward into the room. \\nHe was exactly the same as yesterday; the same figure, the \\nsame dress, but there was a great change in his face; he \\nlooked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put his \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he \\nwould have looked exactly like a peasant woman.\\n‘What do you want?’ asked Raskolnikov, numb with ter -\\nror. The man was still silent, but suddenly he bowed down \\nalmost to the ground, touching it with his finger.\\n‘What is it?’ cried Raskolnikov.\\n‘I have sinned,’ the man articulated softly.\\n‘How?’\\n‘By evil thoughts.’\\nThey looked at one another.\\n‘I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and \\nbade the porters go to the police station and asked about \\nthe blood, I was vexed that they let you go and took you for \\ndrunken.

Intensely unpleasant as it \\nwas, he was forced little by little to accept as a fact beyond \\nrecall what had seemed to him only the day before fan -\\ntastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity \\nhad been gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out \\nof bed, Pyotr Petrovitch immediately looked in the look -\\ning-glass. He was afraid that he had jaundice. However his \\nhealth seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at his noble, \\nclear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of late, \\nPyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in \\nthe conviction that he would find another bride and, per -\\nhaps, even a better one. But coming back to the sense of \\nhis present position, he turned aside and spat vigorously, \\nwhich excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey Semyonovitch \\nLebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was stay -\\ning. That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it \\ndown against his young friend’s account. He had set down \\na good many points against him of late. His anger was re -\\ndoubled when he reflected that he ought not to have told \\nAndrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s inter -\\nview. That was the second mistake he had made in temper, \\nthrough impulsiveness and irritability…. Moreover, all that \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commorning one unpleasantness followed another. He even \\nfound a hitch awaiting him in his legal case in the senate. \\nHe was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat which \\nhad been taken in view of his approaching marriage and \\nwas being redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich \\nGerman tradesman, would not entertain the idea of break -\\ning the contract which had just been signed and insisted \\non the full forfeit money, though Pyotr Petrovitch would \\nbe giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In the \\nsame way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble \\nof the instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not \\nyet removed to the flat.\\n‘Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?’ \\nPyotr Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once \\nmore he had a gleam of desperate hope. ‘Can all that be re -\\nally so irrevocably over? Is it no use to make another effort?’ \\nThe thought of Dounia sent a voluptuous pang through his \\nheart. He endured anguish at that moment, and if it had \\nbeen possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it, \\nPyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\\n‘It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,’ \\nhe thought, as he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s \\nroom, ‘and why on earth was I such a Jew? It was false econ -\\nomy! I meant to keep them without a penny so that they \\nshould turn to me as their providence, and look at them! \\nfoo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for \\nthe trousseau and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, \\njewellery, materials, and all that sort of trash from Knopp’s \\nand the English shop, my position would have been better Crime and Punishment \\x1810and … stronger!

And their conscience would prick them: \\nhow can we dismiss a man who has hitherto been so gener -\\nous and delicate?…. H’m! I’ve made a blunder.’\\nAnd grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called \\nhimself a fool— but not aloud, of course.\\nHe returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. \\nThe preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanov -\\nna’s excited his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it \\nthe day before; he fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, \\nbut absorbed in his own cares he had paid no attention. In -\\nquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy laying the \\ntable while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he \\nheard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all \\nthe lodgers had been invited, among them some who had \\nnot known the dead man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch \\nLebeziatnikov was invited in spite of his previous quarrel \\nwith Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch, was not \\nonly invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most \\nimportant of the lodgers.

He had heard of Andrey Semyonovitch, who \\nhad once been his ward, as a leading young progressive who \\nwas taking an important part in certain interesting circles, \\nthe doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had \\nimpressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient cir -\\ncles who despised everyone and showed everyone up had \\nlong inspired in him a peculiar but quite vague alarm. He \\nhad not, of course, been able to form even an approximate \\nnotion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had heard \\nthat there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of \\nsome sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he ex -\\naggerated and distorted the significance of those words to \\nan absurd degree. What for many years past he had feared \\nmore than anything was being shown up  and this was the \\nchief ground for his continual uneasiness at the thought of \\ntransferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of \\nthis as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some \\nyears before, when he was just entering on his own career, \\nhe had come upon two cases in which rather important \\npersonages in the province, patrons of his, had been cruelly \\nshown up. One instance had ended in great scandal for the Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in se -\\nrious trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to \\ngo into the subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if \\nnecessary, to anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour \\nof ‘our younger generation.’ He relied on Andrey Semyo -\\nnovitch for this and before his visit to Raskolnikov he had \\nsucceeded in picking up some current phrases. He soon \\ndiscovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace \\nsimpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. \\nEven if he had been certain that all the progressives were \\nfools like him, it would not have allayed his uneasiness. All \\nthe doctrines, the ideas, the systems, with which Andrey \\nSemyonovitch pestered him had no interest for him. He had \\nhis own object—he simply wanted to find out at once what \\nwas happening here. Had these people any power or not? \\nHad he anything to fear from them? Would they expose any \\nenterprise of his? And what precisely was now the object of \\ntheir attacks? Could he somehow make up to them and get \\nround them if they really were powerful? Was this the thing \\nto do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In \\nfact hundreds of questions presented themselves.\\nAndrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little \\nman, with strangely flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which \\nhe was very proud. He was a clerk and had almost always \\nsomething wrong with his eyes. He was rather soft-heart -\\ned, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited \\nin speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with \\nhis little figure. He was one of the lodgers most respected \\nby Amalia Ivanovna, for he did not get drunk and paid reg -\\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch really was \\nrather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress \\nand ‘our younger generation’ from enthusiasm. He was one \\nof the numerous and varied legion of dullards, of half-an -\\nimate abortions, conceited, half-educated coxcombs, who \\nattach themselves to the idea most in fashion only to vul -\\ngarise it and who caricature every cause they serve, however \\nsincerely.\\nThough Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was \\nbeginning to dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on \\nboth sides unconsciously. However simple Andrey Semyo -\\nnovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr Petrovitch was \\nduping him and secretly despising him, and that ‘he was \\nnot the right sort of man.’ He had tried expounding to him \\nthe system of Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late \\nPyotr Petrovitch began to listen too sarcastically and even \\nto be rude. The fact was he had begun instinctively to guess \\nthat Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace simple -\\nton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections \\nof any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply \\npicked things up third-hand; and that very likely he did \\nnot even know much about his own work of propaganda, \\nfor he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he would \\nbe to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that \\nPyotr Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accept -\\ned the strangest praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had \\nnot protested, for instance, when Andrey Semyonovitch \\nbelauded him for being ready to contribute to the establish -\\nment of the new ‘commune,’ or to abstain from christening Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take \\na lover a month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch \\nso enjoyed hearing his own praises that he did not disdain \\neven such virtues when they were attributed to him.\\nPyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to re -\\nalise some five- per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the \\ntable and counted over bundles of notes. Andrey Semyo -\\nnovitch who hardly ever had any money walked about the \\nroom pretending to himself to look at all those bank notes \\nwith indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have \\nconvinced Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch \\ncould really look on the money unmoved, and the latter, on \\nhis side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr Petrovitch was \\ncapable of entertaining such an idea about him and was, \\nperhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend \\nby reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference \\nbetween them.\\nHe found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though \\nhe, Andrey Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite \\nsubject, the foundation of a new special ‘commune.’ The \\nbrief remarks that dropped from Pyotr Petrovitch between \\nthe clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame betrayed \\nunmistakable and discourteous irony.

Her eyes rested again for an \\ninstant on the grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that re -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commained on the table, but she quickly looked away and fixed \\nher eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it horribly indecorous, \\nespecially for her to look at another person’s money. She \\nstared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in \\nhis left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome \\nring with a yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly \\nshe looked away and, not knowing where to turn, ended by \\nstaring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight in the face. After a \\npause of still greater dignity he continued.\\n‘I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple \\nof words with Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was \\nsufficient to enable me to ascertain that she is in a position—\\npreternatural, if one may so express it.’\\n‘Yes … preternatural …’ Sonia hurriedly assented.\\n‘Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, \\nill.’\\n‘Yes, simpler and more comprehen … yes, ill.’\\n‘Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to \\nspeak compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in \\nany way, foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the \\nwhole of this poverty-stricken family depends now entirely \\non you?’\\n‘Allow me to ask,’ Sonia rose to her feet, ‘did you say \\nsomething to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension? \\nBecause she told me you had undertaken to get her one. \\nWas that true?’\\n‘Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely \\nhinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow \\nof an official who had died in the service—if only she has Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18patronage … but apparently your late parent had not served \\nhis full term and had not indeed been in the service at all \\nof late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be very \\nephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance \\nin that case, far from it…. And she is dreaming of a pension \\nalready, he-he-he! … A go-ahead lady!’\\n‘Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and \\nshe believes everything from the goodness of her heart and \\n… and … and she is like that … yes … You must excuse her,’ \\nsaid Sonia, and again she got up to go.\\n‘But you haven’t heard what I have to say.’\\n‘No, I haven’t heard,’ muttered Sonia.\\n‘Then sit down.’ She was terribly confused; she sat down \\nagain a third time.\\n‘Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I \\nshould be glad, as I have said before, so far as lies in my \\npower, to be of service, that is, so far as is in my power, not \\nmore. One might for instance get up a subscription for her, \\nor a lottery, something of the sort, such as is always ar -\\nranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous \\nof assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; \\nit might be done.’\\n‘Yes, yes … God will repay you for it,’ faltered Sonia, gaz -\\ning intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.\\n‘It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might be -\\ngin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the \\nfoundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o’clock. Mr. \\nLebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us.

Why do you cling to this \\nlegality  of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you like, but I \\nam glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are free, \\nthat you are not quite lost for humanity…. you see, I’ve spo -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comken my mind!’\\n‘Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a \\nfool of and to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I \\nwant legal marriage,’ Luzhin replied in order to make some \\nanswer.\\nHe seemed preoccupied by something.\\n‘Children? You referred to children,’ Lebeziatnikov start -\\ned off like a warhorse at the trumpet call. ‘Children are a \\nsocial question and a question of first importance, I agree; \\nbut the question of children has another solution. Some re -\\nfuse to have children altogether, because they suggest the \\ninstitution of the family. We’ll speak of children later, but \\nnow as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak \\npoint. That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is un -\\nthinkable in the dictionary of the future. What does it mean \\nindeed? It’s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free \\nmarriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal \\nmarriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed \\nit’s not humiliating … and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, \\nwere to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. \\nI should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, \\nnow I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You \\nlaugh! That’s because you are of incapable of getting away \\nfrom prejudices. Confound it all! I understand now where \\nthe unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, \\nbut it’s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable po -\\nsition in which both are humiliated. When the deception \\nis open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s un -\\nthinkable. Your wife will only prove how she respects you Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180by considering you incapable of opposing her happiness \\nand avenging yourself on her for her new husband. Damn it \\nall! I sometimes dream if I were to be married, pfoo! I mean \\nif I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same, I should \\npresent my wife with a lover if she had not found one for \\nherself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more \\nthan that I desire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?’\\nPyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without \\nmuch merriment. He hardly heard it indeed. He was pre -\\noccupied with something else and even Lebeziatnikov at \\nlast noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited and rubbed \\nhis hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected \\nupon it afterwards.\\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter II\\nIt would be difficult to explain exactly what could have \\noriginated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina \\nIvanovna’s disordered brain. Nearly ten of the twenty rou -\\nbles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s funeral, were \\nwasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to \\nhonour the memory of the deceased ‘suitably,’ that all the \\nlodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know ‘that \\nhe was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their \\nsuperior,’ and that no one had the right ‘to turn up his nose \\nat him.’ Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar ‘poor \\nman’s pride,’ which compels many poor people to spend \\ntheir last savings on some traditional social ceremony, sim -\\nply in order to do ‘like other people,’ and not to ‘be looked \\ndown upon.’ It is very probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna \\nlonged on this occasion, at the moment when she seemed \\nto be abandoned by everyone, to show those ‘wretched con -\\ntemptible lodgers’ that she knew ‘how to do things, how to \\nentertain’ and that she had been brought up ‘in a genteel, she \\nmight almost say aristocratic colonel’s family’ and had not \\nbeen meant for sweeping floors and washing the children’s \\nrags at night. Even the poorest and most broken-spirited \\npeople are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride \\nand vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous \\ncraving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18she might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit \\ncould not have been broken, that is, she could not have been \\nintimidated, her will could not be crushed.

She had undertaken to lay the table, to pro -\\nvide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her \\nkitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands \\nand gone herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well \\ndone. Even the table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, \\nknives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and \\npatterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was prop -\\nerly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she \\nhad done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and \\na cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning \\nparty with some pride. This pride, though justifiable, dis -\\npleased Katerina Ivanovna for some reason: ‘as though the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18table could not have been laid except by Amalia Ivanovna!’ \\nShe disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. ‘Could she be \\nstuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of \\nthe house, and had consented as a favour to help her poor \\nlodgers! As a favour! Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father \\nwho had been a colonel and almost a governor had some -\\ntimes had the table set for forty persons, and then anyone \\nlike Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not \\nhave been allowed into the kitchen.’\\nKaterina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feel -\\nings for the time and contented herself with treating her \\ncoldly, though she decided inwardly that she would cer -\\ntainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down and set her in her \\nproper place, for goodness only knew what she was fancying \\nherself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that \\nhardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, \\nexcept the Pole who had just managed to run into the cem -\\netery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most \\ninsignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, \\nmany of them not quite sober. The older and more respect -\\nable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away. Pyotr \\nPetrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the \\nmost respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though \\nKaterina Ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, \\nthat is Amalia Ivanovna, Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that \\nhe was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large \\nproperty and vast connections, who had been a friend of \\nher first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s house, and \\nthat he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comconsiderable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina \\nIvanovna exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was \\nwithout any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the \\nmere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person \\npraised. Probably ‘taking his cue’ from Luzhin, ‘that con -\\ntemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. \\nWhat did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kind -\\nness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr \\nPetrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have \\nbeen awkward not to invite him.’\\nAmong those who failed to appear were ‘the genteel lady \\nand her old- maidish daughter,’ who had only been lodg -\\ners in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times \\ncomplained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna’s \\nroom, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk. \\nKaterina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who, \\nquarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn \\nthe whole family out of doors, had shouted at her that they \\n‘were not worth the foot’ of the honourable lodgers whom \\nthey were disturbing. Katerina Ivanovna determined now \\nto invite this lady and her daughter, ‘whose foot she was not \\nworth,’ and who had turned away haughtily when she casu -\\nally met them, so that they might know that ‘she was more \\nnoble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour mal -\\nice,’ and might see that she was not accustomed to her way \\nof living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at \\ndinner with allusions to her late father’s governorship, and \\nalso at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid \\nof them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18(he was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also ab -\\nsent, but it appeared that he had been ‘not himself’ for the \\nlast two days. The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched \\nlooking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had \\nnot a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf \\nand almost blind old man who had once been in the post of -\\nfice and who had been from immemorial ages maintained \\nby someone at Amalia Ivanovna’s.\\nA retired clerk of the commissariat department came, \\ntoo; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and \\nonly fancy—was without a waistcoat!

The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles \\nwho did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s and whom no one \\nhad seen here before.

But Sonia became \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commore and more anxious and distressed; she, too, foresaw \\nthat the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with ter -\\nror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that \\nshe, Sonia, was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ con -\\ntemptuous treatment of Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She \\nhad heard from Amalia Ivanovna that the mother was posi -\\ntively offended at the invitation and had asked the question: \\n‘How could she let her daughter sit down beside that young \\nperson ?’ Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had \\nalready heard this and an insult to Sonia meant more to \\nKaterina Ivanovna than an insult to herself, her children, or \\nher father, Sonia knew that Katerina Ivanovna would not \\nbe satisfied now, ‘till she had shown those draggletails that \\nthey were both …’ To make matters worse someone passed \\nSonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two \\nhearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Kateri -\\nna Ivanovna flushed crimson and at once said aloud across \\nthe table that the man who sent it was ‘a drunken ass!’\\nAmalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and \\nat the same time deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s \\nhaughtiness, and to restore the good-humour of the com -\\npany and raise herself in their esteem she began, apropos of \\nnothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers ‘Karl \\nfrom the chemist’s,’ who was driving one night in a cab, and \\nthat ‘the cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much \\nbegged him not to kill, and wept and clasped hands, and \\nfrightened and from fear pierced his heart.’ Though Kat -\\nerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that Amalia \\nIvanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18was still more offended, and she retorted that her ‘ Vater aus \\nBerlin  was a very important man, and always went with his \\nhands in pockets.’ Katerina Ivanovna could not restrain \\nherself and laughed so much that Amalia Ivanovna lost pa -\\ntience and could scarcely control herself.\\n‘Listen to the owl!’ Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, \\nher good- humour almost restored, ‘she meant to say he \\nkept his hands in his pockets, but she said he put his hands \\nin people’s pockets.

To this Amalia Ivanovna \\nvery appropriately observed that she had invited those la -\\ndies, but ‘those ladies had not come, because those ladies \\nare ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.’ Kat -\\nerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a \\nslut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia \\nIvanovna at once declared that her ‘ Vater aus Berlin  was a \\nvery, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, \\nand always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’’ and she leapt up from \\nthe table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her \\npockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds \\nresembling ‘poof! poof!’ amid loud laughter from all the \\nlodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hop -\\ning for a fight.\\nBut this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at \\nonce declared, so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanov -\\nna probably never had a father, but was simply a drunken \\nPetersburg Finn, and had certainly once been a cook and \\nprobably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red \\nas a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna \\nnever had a father, ‘but she had a Vater aus Berlin  and that \\nhe wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!’\\nKaterina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all \\nknew what her family was and that on that very certificate \\nof honour it was stated in print that her father was a colonel, \\nwhile Amalia Ivanovna’s father—if she really had one—was \\nprobably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she \\nnever had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18her name was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.\\nAt this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the \\ntable with her fist, and shrieked that she was Amalia Iva -\\nnovna, and not Ludwigovna, ‘that her Vater  was named \\nJohann and that he was a burgomeister, and that Katerina \\nIvanovna’s Vater  was quite never a burgomeister.’ Katerina \\nIvanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and appar -\\nently calm voice (though she was pale and her chest was \\nheaving) observed that ‘if she dared for one moment to set \\nher contemptible wretch of a father on a level with her papa, \\nshe, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her head \\nand trample it under foot.’ Amalia Ivanovna ran about the \\nroom, shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress \\nof the house and that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the \\nlodgings that minute; then she rushed for some reason to \\ncollect the silver spoons from the table. There was a great \\noutcry and uproar, the children began crying.

I know nothing about it,’ Sonia articu -\\nlated faintly at last.\\n‘No, you know nothing?’ Luzhin repeated and again he \\npaused for some seconds. ‘Think a moment, mademoiselle,’ \\nhe began severely, but still, as it were, admonishing her. \\n‘Reflect, I am prepared to give you time for consideration. \\nKindly observe this: if I were not so entirely convinced I \\nshould not, you may be sure, with my experience venture \\nto accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accu -\\nsation before witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should \\nmyself in a certain sense be made responsible, I am aware \\nof that. This morning I changed for my own purposes sev -\\neral five-per-cent securities for the sum of approximately \\nthree thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my \\npocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the \\nmoney—as Mr. Lebeziatnikov will bear witness—and after \\ncounting two thousand three hundred roubles I put the rest \\nin my pocket-book in my coat pocket. About five hundred \\nroubles remained on the table and among them three notes \\nof a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at \\nmy invitation)—and all the time you were present you were \\nexceedingly embarrassed; so that three times you jumped \\nup in the middle of the conversation and tried to make off. \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness to this. You yourself, \\nmademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm my state -\\nment that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely \\nin order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute po -\\nsition of your relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner \\nI was unable to attend), and the advisability of getting up Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18something of the nature of a subscription, lottery or the \\nlike, for her benefit. You thanked me and even shed tears. \\nI describe all this as it took place, primarily to recall it to \\nyour mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest \\ndetail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten- rou -\\nble note from the table and handed it to you by way of first \\ninstalment on my part for the benefit of your relative. Mr. \\nLebeziatnikov saw all this. Then I accompanied you to the \\ndoor—you being still in the same state of embarrassment—\\nafter which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I talked \\nto him for ten minutes— then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out \\nand I returned to the table with the money lying on it, in -\\ntending to count it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing \\nbefore. To my surprise one hundred-rouble note had disap -\\npeared. Kindly consider the position. Mr. Lebeziatnikov I \\ncannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such a suppo -\\nsition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for \\nthe minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts \\nand found the total correct. You will admit that recollect -\\ning your embarrassment, your eagerness to get away and \\nthe fact that you kept your hands for some time on the table, \\nand taking into consideration your social position and the \\nhabits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and \\npositively against my will, compelled  to entertain a suspi -\\ncion—a cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further \\nand repeat that in spite of my positive conviction, I realise \\nthat I run a certain risk in making this accusation, but as \\nyou see, I could not let it pass. I have taken action and I will \\ntell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing to your black in -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comgratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your destitute \\nrelative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and \\nyou, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It \\nis too bad!

You \\nfolded it and kept it in your hand all the time. I didn’t think \\nof it again until, when you were getting up, you changed it \\nfrom your right hand to your left and nearly dropped it!

So I \\ngave it to her on the sly on purpose? What for? With what \\nobject? What have I to do with this …?’\\n‘What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what \\nI am telling you is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my \\nbeing mistaken, you infamous criminal man, I remember \\nhow, on account of it, a question occurred to me at once, \\njust when I was thanking you and pressing your hand. \\nWhat made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did \\nit secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comme, knowing that my convictions are opposed to yours \\nand that I do not approve of private benevolence, which ef -\\nfects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you really were \\nashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps, \\ntoo, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she \\nfinds a whole hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I \\nknow, some benevolent people are very fond of decking out \\ntheir charitable actions in that way.) Then the idea struck \\nme, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether, when \\nshe found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that \\nyou wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your \\nright hand should not know … something of that sort, in \\nfact. I thought of so many possibilities that I put off con -\\nsidering it, but still thought it indelicate to show you that \\nI knew your secret. But another idea struck me again that \\nSofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she \\nnoticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call \\nher out of the room and to tell her that you put a hundred \\nroubles in her pocket. But on my way I went first to Ma -\\ndame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the ‘General Treatise on \\nthe Positive Method’ and especially to recommend Piderit’s \\narticle (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what \\na state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these \\nideas and reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-\\nrouble note in her pocket?’\\nWhen Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue \\nwith the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, \\nand the perspiration streamed from his face. He could not, \\nalas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, \\nalmost emaciated after this heroic exploit.

He at once wrote a note \\nto my mother and informed her that I had given away all my \\nmoney, not to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, \\nand referred in a most contemptible way to the … charac -\\nter of Sofya Semyonovna, that is, hinted at the character of \\nmy attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you understand \\nwas with the object of dividing me from my mother and \\nsister, by insinuating that I was squandering on unwor -\\nthy objects the money which they had sent me and which \\nwas all they had. Yesterday evening, before my mother and \\nsister and in his presence, I declared that I had given the \\nmoney to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to So -\\nfya Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya \\nSemyonovna and had never seen her before, indeed. At the \\nsame time I added that he, Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with \\nall his virtues, was not worth Sofya Semyonovna’s little fin -\\nger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his question—would I Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I answered \\nthat I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother \\nand sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insin -\\nuations, he gradually began being unpardonably rude to \\nthem. A final rupture took place and he was turned out of \\nthe house. All this happened yesterday evening. Now I beg \\nyour special attention: consider: if he had now succeeded in \\nproving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would have \\nshown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in \\nhis suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my put -\\nting my sister on a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in \\nattacking me, he was protecting and preserving the honour \\nof my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might even, through \\nall this, have been able to estrange me from my family, and \\nno doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say \\nnothing of revenging himself on me personally, for he has \\ngrounds for supposing that the honour and happiness of \\nSofya Semyonovna are very precious to me. That was what \\nhe was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s the \\nwhole reason for it and there can be no other!’\\nIt was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov \\nwound up his speech which was followed very attentively, \\nthough often interrupted by exclamations from his audi -\\nence. But in spite of interruptions he spoke clearly, calmly, \\nexactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of conviction \\nand his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\\n‘Yes, yes, that’s it,’ Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, ‘that \\nmust be it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna \\ncame into our room, whether you were here, whether I had \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comseen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s guests. He called me \\naside to the window and asked me in secret. It was essential \\nfor him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!’\\nLuzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But \\nhe was very pale. He seemed to be deliberating on some \\nmeans of escape. Perhaps he would have been glad to give \\nup everything and get away, but at the moment this was \\nscarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth \\nof the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the com -\\npany, which had already been excited by drink, was now too \\nmuch stirred to allow it. The commissariat clerk, though in -\\ndeed he had not grasped the whole position, was shouting \\nlouder than anyone and was making some suggestions very \\nunpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; \\nlodgers came in from all the rooms. The three Poles were \\ntremendously excited and were continually shouting at him: \\n‘The pan is a lajdak !’ and muttering threats in Polish. Sonia \\nhad been listening with strained attention, though she too \\nseemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as though she had \\njust returned to consciousness. She did not take her eyes off \\nRaskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina \\nIvanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearful -\\nly exhausted.

Quick march!’\\nAnd with these words she began snatching up every -\\nthing she could lay her hands on that belonged to Katerina \\nIvanovna, and throwing it on the floor. Katerina Ivanovna, \\npale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath, jumped up \\nfrom the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and dart -\\ned at Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the \\nlandlady waved her away like a feather.\\n‘What! As though that godless calumny was not enough—\\nthis vile creature attacks me! What! On the day of my \\nhusband’s funeral I am turned out of my lodging! After eat -\\ning my bread and salt she turns me into the street, with my Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18orphans! Where am I to go?’ wailed the poor woman, sob -\\nbing and gasping. ‘Good God!’ she cried with flashing eyes, \\n‘is there no justice upon earth? Whom should you protect \\nif not us orphans? We shall see! There is law and justice on \\nearth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit, godless creature! Po -\\nlenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait for me, if \\nyou have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is \\njustice on earth!’\\nAnd throwing over her head that green shawl which \\nMarmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina \\nIvanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and \\ndrunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, \\nwailing and tearful, she ran into the street—with a vague \\nintention of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polen -\\nka with the two little ones in her arms crouched, terrified, \\non the trunk in the corner of the room, where she waited \\ntrembling for her mother to come back. Amalia Ivanovna \\nraged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing \\neverything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked \\nincoherently, some commented to the best of their ability \\non what had happened, others quarrelled and swore at one \\nanother, while others struck up a song….\\n‘Now it’s time for me to go,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Well, \\nSofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’\\nAnd he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IV\\nRaskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion \\nof Sonia against Luzhin, although he had such a load \\nof horror and anguish in his own heart. But having gone \\nthrough so much in the morning, he found a sort of relief \\nin a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal \\nfeeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agi -\\ntated too, especially at some moments, by the thought of his \\napproaching interview with Sonia: he had to tell her who \\nhad killed Lizaveta. He knew the terrible suffering it would \\nbe to him and, as it were, brushed away the thought of it. \\nSo when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, ‘Well, So -\\nfya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!’ he was \\nstill superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from \\nhis triumph over Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time \\nhe reached Sonia’s lodging, he felt a sudden impotence and \\nfear. He stood still in hesitation at the door, asking himself \\nthe strange question: ‘Must he tell her who killed Lizaveta?’ \\nIt was a strange question because he felt at the very time not \\nonly that he could not help telling her, but also that he could \\nnot put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be \\nso, he only felt it, and the agonising sense of his impotence \\nbefore the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his \\nhesitation and suffering, he quickly opened the door and \\nlooked at Sonia from the doorway. She was sitting with her Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180elbows on the table and her face in her hands, but seeing \\nRaskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet him as \\nthough she were expecting him.\\n‘What would have become of me but for you?’ she said \\nquickly, meeting him in the middle of the room.\\nEvidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what \\nshe had been waiting for.\\nRaskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair \\nfrom which she had only just risen. She stood facing him, \\ntwo steps away, just as she had done the day before.\\n‘Well, Sonia?’ he said, and felt that his voice was trem -\\nbling, ‘it was all due to ‘your social position and the habits \\nassociated with it.’ Did you understand that just now?’\\nHer face showed her distress.\\n‘Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,’ she inter -\\nrupted him. ‘Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough \\nwithout that.’\\nShe made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like \\nthe reproach.\\n‘I was silly to come away from there. What is happening \\nthere now? I wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking \\nthat … you would come.’\\nHe told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out \\nof their lodging and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off  \\nsomewhere ‘to seek justice.’\\n‘My God!’ cried Sonia, ‘let’s go at once….’\\nAnd she snatched up her cape.\\n‘It’s everlastingly the same thing!’ said Raskolnikov, irri -\\ntably. ‘You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comme.’\\n‘But … Katerina Ivanovna?’\\n‘You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, \\nshe’ll come to you herself since she has run out,’ he added \\npeevishly. ‘If she doesn’t find you here, you’ll be blamed for \\nit….’\\nSonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was si -\\nlent, gazing at the floor and deliberating.\\n‘This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,’ he be -\\ngan, not looking at Sonia, ‘but if he had wanted to, if it had \\nsuited his plans, he would have sent you to prison if it had \\nnot been for Lebeziatnikov and me. Ah?’\\n‘Yes,’ she assented in a faint voice. ‘Yes,’ she repeated, pre -\\noccupied and distressed.\\n‘But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite \\nan accident Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.’\\nSonia was silent.\\n‘And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remem -\\nber what I said yesterday?’\\nAgain she did not answer. He waited.\\n‘I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, \\nleave off.’’ Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. \\n‘What, silence again?’ he asked a minute later. ‘We must \\ntalk about something, you know. It would be interesting \\nfor me to know how you would decide a certain ‘problem’ \\nas Lebeziatnikov would say.’ (He was beginning to lose the \\nthread.) ‘No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you \\nhad known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand.

Well, if suddenly it all depended on \\nyour decision whether he or they should go on living, that \\nis whether Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked \\nthings, or Katerina Ivanovna should die? How would you \\ndecide which of them was to die? I ask you?’\\nSonia looked uneasily at him.

Five minutes passed.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘Of course you’re right, Sonia,’ he said softly at last. He \\nwas suddenly changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and \\nhelpless defiance was gone. Even his voice was sudden -\\nly weak. ‘I told you yesterday that I was not coming to ask \\nforgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask for -\\ngiveness…. I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my \\nown sake. I was asking forgiveness, Sonia….’\\nHe tried to smile, but there was something helpless and \\nincomplete in his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his \\nface in his hands.\\nAnd suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of \\nbitter hatred for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were \\nwondering and frightened of this sensation, he raised his \\nhead and looked intently at her; but he met her uneasy and \\npainfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was love in them; \\nhis hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real feel -\\ning; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant \\nthat that minute had come.\\nHe hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. \\nSuddenly he turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at \\nSonia, and without uttering a word sat down mechanically \\non her bed.\\nHis sensations that moment were terribly like the mo -\\nment when he had stood over the old woman with the axe in \\nhis hand and felt that ‘he must not lose another minute.’\\n‘What’s the matter?’ asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.\\nHe could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all \\nthe way he had intended to ‘tell’ and he did not understand \\nwhat was happening to him now. She went up to him, softly, Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18sat down on the bed beside him and waited, not taking her \\neyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It was unendur -\\nable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked, \\nhelplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror \\npassed through Sonia’s heart.\\n‘What’s the matter?’ she repeated, drawing a little away \\nfrom him.\\n‘Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened…. It’s nonsense. \\nIt really is nonsense, if you think of it,’ he muttered, like \\na man in delirium. ‘Why have I come to torture you?’ he \\nadded suddenly, looking at her. ‘Why, really? I keep asking \\nmyself that question, Sonia….’\\nHe had perhaps been asking himself that question \\na quarter of an hour before, but now he spoke helplessly, \\nhardly knowing what he said and feeling a continual tremor \\nall over.\\n‘Oh, how you are suffering!’ she muttered in distress, \\nlooking intently at him.\\n‘It’s all nonsense…. Listen, Sonia.’ He suddenly smiled, a \\npale helpless smile for two seconds. ‘You remember what I \\nmeant to tell you yesterday?’\\nSonia waited uneasily.\\n‘I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye \\nfor ever, but that if I came to-day I would tell you who … \\nwho killed Lizaveta.’\\nShe began trembling all over.\\n‘Well, here I’ve come to tell you.’\\n‘Then you really meant it yesterday?’ she whispered with \\ndifficulty. ‘How do you know?’ she asked quickly, as though \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsuddenly regaining her reason.\\nSonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed pain -\\nfully.\\n‘I know.’\\nShe paused a minute.\\n‘Have they found him?’ she asked timidly.\\n‘No.’\\n‘Then how do you know about it?’ she asked again, hardly \\naudibly and again after a minute’s pause.\\nHe turned to her and looked very intently at her.\\n‘Guess,’ he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\\nA shudder passed over her.\\n‘But you … why do you frighten me like this?’ she said, \\nsmiling like a child.\\n‘I must be a great friend of his … since I know,’ Raskol -\\nnikov went on, still gazing into her face, as though he could \\nnot turn his eyes away. ‘He … did not mean to kill that Liza -\\nveta … he … killed her accidentally….

In his changed tone she seemed to hear the \\nmurderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She \\nknew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. \\nNow all these questions rushed at once into her mind. And \\nagain she could not believe it: ‘He, he is a murderer!

How could you \\nbring yourself to it? … What does it mean?’\\n‘Oh, well—to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,’ he answered \\nwearily, almost with vexation.\\nSonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she \\ncried:\\n‘You were hungry! It was … to help your mother? Yes?’\\n‘No, Sonia, no,’ he muttered, turning away and hanging \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhis head. ‘I was not so hungry….

Good God, what a truth! \\nWho could believe it? And how could you give away your \\nlast farthing and yet rob and murder! Ah,’ she cried sud -\\ndenly, ‘that money you gave Katerina Ivanovna … that \\nmoney…. Can that money …’\\n‘No, Sonia,’ he broke in hurriedly, ‘that money was not \\nit. Don’t worry yourself! That money my mother sent me \\nand it came when I was ill, the day I gave it to you…. Ra -\\nzumihin saw it … he received it for me…. That money was \\nmine—my own.’\\nSonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her ut -\\nmost to comprehend.\\n‘And that money…. I don’t even know really whether \\nthere was any money,’ he added softly, as though reflect -\\ning. ‘I took a purse off her neck, made of chamois leather … \\na purse stuffed full of something … but I didn’t look in it; I \\nsuppose I hadn’t time….

I haven’t yet decided whether to take that \\nmoney or not,’ he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake \\nup with a start, he gave a brief ironical smile. ‘Ach, what silly Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180stuff I am talking, eh?’\\nThe thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he \\nmad? But she dismissed it at once. ‘No, it was something \\nelse.’ She could make nothing of it, nothing.\\n‘Do you know, Sonia,’ he said suddenly with conviction, \\n‘let me tell you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,’ \\nlaying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but \\nsincerely at her, ‘I should be happy  now.

Well, would he have brought \\nhimself to that if there had been no other means? Wouldn’t \\nhe have felt a pang at its being so far from monumental and \\n… and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I worried myself \\nfearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully ashamed \\nwhen I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it \\nwould not have given him the least pang, that it would not \\neven have struck him that it was not monumental … that he \\nwould not have seen that there was anything in it to pause \\nover, and that, if he had had no other way, he would have \\nstrangled her in a minute without thinking about it! Well, I \\ntoo … left off thinking about it … murdered her, following \\nhis example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it \\nfunny? Yes, Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps \\nthat’s just how it was.’\\nSonia did not think it at all funny.\\n‘You had better tell me straight out … without examples,’ \\nshe begged, still more timidly and scarcely audibly.\\nHe turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her \\nhands.\\n‘You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, \\nit’s almost all talk! You see, you know of course that my \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commother has scarcely anything, my sister happened to have \\na good education and was condemned to drudge as a gov -\\nerness. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a student, \\nbut I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced \\nfor a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in \\nten or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some \\nsort of teacher or clerk with a salary of a thousand rou -\\nbles’ (he repeated it as though it were a lesson) ‘and by that \\ntime my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety \\nand I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while \\nmy sister … well, my sister might well have fared worse! \\nAnd it’s a hard thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to \\nturn one’s back upon everything, to forget one’s mother and \\ndecorously accept the insults inflicted on one’s sister. Why \\nshould one? When one has buried them to burden oneself \\nwith others—wife and children—and to leave them again \\nwithout a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the \\nold woman’s money and to use it for my first years with -\\nout worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university \\nand for a little while after leaving it—and to do this all on \\na broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new \\ncareer and enter upon a new life of independence….

What will you live for?’ \\ncried Sonia, ‘how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk \\nto your mother? (Oh, what will become of them now?) But \\nwhat am I saying? You have abandoned your mother and \\nyour sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh, \\nGod!’ she cried, ‘why, he knows it all himself. How, how can \\nhe live by himself! What will become of you now?’\\n‘Don’t be a child, Sonia,’ he said softly. ‘What wrong \\nhave I done them? Why should I go to them? What should \\nI say to them? That’s only a phantom…. They destroy men \\nby millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are \\nknaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180what should I say to them—that I murdered her, but did \\nnot dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?’ he \\nadded with a bitter smile. ‘Why, they would laugh at me, \\nand would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a \\nfool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve to \\nunderstand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a \\nchild, Sonia….’\\n‘It will be too much for you to bear, too much!’ she re -\\npeated, holding out her hands in despairing supplication.\\n‘Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,’ he observed gloom -\\nily, pondering, ‘perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse \\nand I’ve been in too great a hurry to condemn myself. I’ll \\nmake another fight for it.’\\nA haughty smile appeared on his lips.\\n‘What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole \\nlife!’\\n‘I shall get used to it,’ he said grimly and thoughtfully. \\n‘Listen,’ he began a minute later, ‘stop crying, it’s time to talk \\nof the facts: I’ve come to tell you that the police are after me, \\non my track….’\\n‘Ach!’ Sonia cried in terror.\\n‘Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Sibe -\\nria and now you are frightened? But let me tell you: I shall \\nnot give myself up. I shall make a struggle for it and they \\nwon’t do anything to me. They’ve no real evidence. Yester -\\nday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day \\nthings are going better. All the facts they know can be ex -\\nplained two ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations \\nto my credit, do you understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commy lesson. But they will certainly arrest me. If it had not \\nbeen for something that happened, they would have done so \\nto-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-\\nday…. But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out again … \\nfor there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be, \\nI give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on \\nwhat they have against me. Enough…. I only tell you that \\nyou may know…. I will try to manage somehow to put it to \\nmy mother and sister so that they won’t be frightened…. My \\nsister’s future is secure, however, now, I believe … and my \\nmother’s must be too…. Well, that’s all. Be careful, though. \\nWill you come and see me in prison when I am there?’\\n‘Oh, I will, I will.’\\nThey sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as \\nthough they had been cast up by the tempest alone on some \\ndeserted shore. He looked at Sonia and felt how great was \\nher love for him, and strange to say he felt it suddenly bur -\\ndensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a strange \\nand awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that \\nall his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least \\npart of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned \\ntowards him, he suddenly felt that he was immeasurably \\nunhappier than before.\\n‘Sonia,’ he said, ‘you’d better not come and see me when \\nI am in prison.’\\nSonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes \\npassed.\\n‘Have you a cross on you?’ she asked, as though suddenly \\nthinking of it.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18He did not at first understand the question.\\n‘No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. \\nI have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I \\nchanged with Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her \\nmy little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. \\nTake it … it’s mine! It’s mine, you know,’ she begged him. \\n‘We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our \\ncross!’\\n‘Give it me,’ said Raskolnikov.\\nHe did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he \\ndrew back the hand he held out for the cross.\\n‘Not now, Sonia. Better later,’ he added to comfort her.\\n‘Yes, yes, better,’ she repeated with conviction, ‘when you \\ngo to meet your suffering, then put it on. You will come to \\nme, I’ll put it on you, we will pray and go together.’\\nAt that moment someone knocked three times at the \\ndoor.\\n‘Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?’ they heard in a very \\nfamiliar and polite voice.\\nSonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of \\nMr. Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter V\\nLebeziatnikov looked perturbed.\\n‘I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,’ he began. ‘Ex -\\ncuse me … I thought I should find you,’ he said, addressing \\nRaskolnikov suddenly, ‘that is, I didn’t mean anything … of \\nthat sort … But I just thought … Katerina Ivanovna has \\ngone out of her mind,’ he blurted out suddenly, turning \\nfrom Raskolnikov to Sonia.\\nSonia screamed.\\n‘At least it seems so.

He looked \\nat the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa…. \\nFrom the yard came a loud continuous knocking; someone \\nseemed to be hammering … He went to the window, rose \\non tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with \\nan air of absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and \\nhe could not see who was hammering. In the house on the \\nleft he saw some open windows; on the window-sills were \\npots of sickly-looking geraniums.

He turned away \\nand sat down on the sofa.Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!\\nYes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to \\nhate Sonia, now that he had made her more miserable.\\n‘Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need \\nhad he to poison her life? Oh, the meanness of it!’\\n‘I will remain alone,’ he said resolutely, ‘and she shall not \\ncome to the prison!’\\nFive minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. \\nThat was a strange thought.\\n‘Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,’ he thought \\nsuddenly.\\nHe could not have said how long he sat there with vague \\nthoughts surging through his mind. All at once the door \\nopened and Dounia came in. At first she stood still and \\nlooked at him from the doorway, just as he had done at So -\\nnia; then she came in and sat down in the same place as \\nyesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and \\nalmost vacantly at her.\\n‘Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,’ \\nsaid Dounia.\\nHer face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were \\nbright and soft. He saw that she too had come to him with \\nlove.\\n‘Brother, now I know all, all. Dmitri Prokofitch has ex -\\nplained and told me everything.

That’s what I am afraid of. As for your cutting \\nyourself off from us, I don’t judge you, I don’t venture to \\njudge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it. I feel \\nthat I too, if I had so great a trouble, should keep away from \\neveryone. I shall tell mother nothing of this  but I shall talk \\nabout you continually and shall tell her from you that you \\nwill come very soon. Don’t worry about her; I will set her \\nmind at rest; but don’t you try her too much—come once \\nat least; remember that she is your mother. And now I have \\ncome simply to say’ (Dounia began to get up) ‘that if you \\nshould need me or should need … all my life or anything … \\ncall me, and I’ll come.

Good-bye, Dounia.’\\nDounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.\\n‘But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for \\never that you … give me such a parting message?’\\n‘Never mind…. Good-bye.’\\nHe turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a \\nmoment, looked at him uneasily, and went out troubled.\\nNo, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very \\nlast one) when he had longed to take her in his arms and say \\ngood-bye  to her, and even to tell  her, but he had not dared Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18even to touch her hand.\\n‘Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I \\nembraced her, and will feel that I stole her kiss.’\\n‘And would she stand that test?’ he went on a few minutes \\nlater to himself. ‘No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand \\nthings!

Her wasted consumptive face looked more \\nsuffering than ever, and indeed out of doors in the sunshine \\na consumptive always looks worse than at home. But her ex -\\ncitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew \\nmore intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, \\ncoaxed them, told them before the crowd how to dance and Crime and Punishment \\x1800what to sing, began explaining to them why it was neces -\\nsary, and driven to desperation by their not understanding, \\nbeat them…. Then she would make a rush at the crowd; if \\nshe noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, \\nshe immediately appealed to him to see what these children \\n‘from a genteel, one may say aristocratic, house’ had been \\nbrought to. If she heard laughter or jeering in the crowd, \\nshe would rush at once at the scoffers and begin squabbling \\nwith them. Some people laughed, others shook their heads, \\nbut everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman \\nwith the frightened children. The frying-pan of which Le -\\nbeziatnikov had spoken was not there, at least Raskolnikov \\ndid not see it. But instead of rapping on the pan, Katerina \\nIvanovna began clapping her wasted hands, when she made \\nLida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in \\nthe singing, but broke down at the second note with a fear -\\nful cough, which made her curse in despair and even shed \\ntears. What made her most furious was the weeping and ter -\\nror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had been made to dress \\nthe children up as street singers are dressed. The boy had \\non a turban made of something red and white to look like a \\nTurk. There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a \\nred knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to \\nMarmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich \\nfeather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna’s grandmother’s \\nand had been preserved as a family possession. Polenka was \\nin her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her \\nmother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly \\nrealised her mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about \\x1801 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comher. She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd. \\nSonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseech -\\ning her to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to \\nbe persuaded.\\n‘Leave off, Sonia, leave off,’ she shouted, speaking fast, \\npanting and coughing. ‘You don’t know what you ask; you \\nare like a child! I’ve told you before that I am not coming \\nback to that drunken German. Let everyone, let all Pe -\\ntersburg see the children begging in the streets, though \\ntheir father was an honourable man who served all his life \\nin truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.’ \\n(Katerina Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story \\nand thoroughly believed it.) ‘Let that wretch of a general see \\nit! And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. \\nWe have worried you enough, I won’t go on so! Ah, Rodi -\\non Romanovitch, is that you?’ she cried, seeing Raskolnikov \\nand rushing up to him. ‘Explain to this silly girl, please, that \\nnothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn \\ntheir living, and everyone will see at once that we are differ -\\nent, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced \\nto beggary. And that general will lose his post, you’ll see! \\nWe shall perform under his windows every day, and if the \\nTsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children before \\nme, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is \\nthe father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, \\nyou’ll see, and that wretch of a general…. Lida, tenez vous \\ndroite ! Kolya, you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? \\nWhimpering again! What are you afraid of, stupid? Good -\\nness, what am I to do with them, Rodion Romanovitch? If Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with \\nsuch children?’\\nAnd she, almost crying herself—which did not stop her \\nuninterrupted, rapid flow of talk—pointed to the crying \\nchildren. Raskolnikov tried to persuade her to go home, \\nand even said, hoping to work on her vanity, that it was \\nunseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like an \\norgan-grinder, as she was intending to become the princi -\\npal of a boarding-school.\\n‘A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,’ cried \\nKaterina Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. ‘No, Ro -\\ndion Romanovitch, that dream is over! All have forsaken \\nus! … And that general…. You know, Rodion Romanovitch, \\nI threw an inkpot at him—it happened to be standing in \\nthe waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. \\nI wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the \\nscoundrels, the scoundrels! But enough of them, now I’ll \\nprovide for the children myself, I won’t bow down to any -\\nbody! She has had to bear enough for us!’ she pointed to \\nSonia. ‘Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, \\nonly two farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us \\nnothing, only run after us, putting their tongues out. There, \\nwhat is that blockhead laughing at?’ (She pointed to a man \\nin the crowd.) ‘It’s all because Kolya here is so stupid; I have \\nsuch a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka? Tell \\nme in French, parlez-moi français . Why, I’ve taught you, \\nyou know some phrases. Else how are you to show that you \\nare of good family, well brought-up children, and not at all \\nlike other organ-grinders? We aren’t going to have a Punch \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comand Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel song…. Ah, \\nyes, … What are we to sing? You keep putting me out, but \\nwe … you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, \\nto find something to sing and get money, something Kolya \\ncan dance to…. For, as you can fancy, our performance is \\nall impromptu…. We must talk it over and rehearse it all \\nthoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky, where there are \\nfar more people of good society, and we shall be noticed at \\nonce. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ \\nand everyone sings that. We must sing something far more \\ngenteel…. Well, have you thought of anything, Polenka? If \\nonly you’d help your mother! My memory’s quite gone, or I \\nshould have thought of something.

Walking outside the city gates one day, he positive -\\nly fancied that they had fixed a meeting there, that he was \\nwaiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another time he woke up before \\ndaybreak lying on the ground under some bushes and could \\nnot at first understand how he had come there.\\nBut during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanov -\\nna’s death, he had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at \\nSonia’s lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment. \\nThey exchanged a few words and made no reference to the \\nvital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak \\nof it for a time.\\nKaterina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, \\nSvidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral. \\nSonia too was very busy. At their last meeting Svidrigaïlov \\ninformed Raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, \\nand a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s chil -\\ndren; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comin getting hold of certain personages by whose help the \\nthree orphans could be at once placed in very suitable insti -\\ntutions; that the money he had settled on them had been of \\ngreat assistance, as it is much easier to place orphans with \\nsome property than destitute ones. He said something too \\nabout Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two \\nto see Raskolnikov, mentioning that ‘he would like to con -\\nsult with him, that there were things they must talk over….’\\nThis conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. \\nSvidrigaïlov looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, \\nafter a brief pause, dropping his voice, asked: ‘But how is \\nit, Rodion Romanovitch; you don’t seem yourself? You look \\nand you listen, but you don’t seem to understand. Cheer up! \\nWe’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve so much to do \\nof my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion Roma -\\nnovitch,’ he added suddenly, ‘what all men need is fresh air, \\nfresh air … more than anything!’\\nHe moved to one side to make way for the priest and \\nserver, who were coming up the stairs. They had come for \\nthe requiem service. By Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung \\ntwice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov went his way. Raskol -\\nnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed the priest \\ninto Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly, \\nslowly and mournfully singing the service. From his child -\\nhood the thought of death and the presence of death had \\nsomething oppressive and mysteriously awful; and it was \\nlong since he had heard the requiem service. And there was \\nsomething else here as well, too awful and disturbing. He \\nlooked at the children: they were all kneeling by the cof -Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18fin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly \\nand, as it were, timidly weeping.\\n‘These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she \\nhasn’t glanced at me,’ Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The \\nsunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; \\nthe priest read, ‘Give rest, oh Lord….’ Raskolnikov stayed \\nall through the service. As he blessed them and took his \\nleave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service, \\nRaskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and \\nlet her head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly ges -\\nture bewildered Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that \\nthere was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no \\ntremor in her hand. It was the furthest limit of self-abnega -\\ntion, at least so he interpreted it.\\nSonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and \\nwent out. He felt very miserable. If it had been possible to \\nescape to some solitude, he would have thought himself \\nlucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there. But al -\\nthough he had almost always been by himself of late, he \\nhad never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out \\nof the town on to the high road, once he had even reached \\na little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he \\nseemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him. It did \\nnot frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made \\nhaste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to \\nenter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thorough -\\nfares.

He felt, so to speak, renewed; \\nagain the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\\n‘Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too sti -\\nfling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A \\nlethargy had come upon him at times. From the moment of \\nthe scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he had been suffocating, \\npenned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s confes -\\nsion, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his \\nbehaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike any -\\nthing he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown \\nfeebler, instantly and fundamentally! And he had agreed at \\nthe time with Sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not \\ngo on living alone with such a thing on his mind!\\n‘And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle … He worried him, that \\nwas true, but somehow not on the same point. He might \\nstill have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, \\ntoo, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different \\nmatter.\\n‘And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, \\nhad explained it psychologically . He had begun bringing in \\nhis damned psychology again! Porfiry? But to think that \\nPorfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was \\nguilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s \\nappearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could \\nhave only one explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov \\nhad often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he \\ncould not bear to let his mind rest on it.) Such words, such \\ngestures had passed between them, they had exchanged \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsuch glances, things had been said in such a tone and had \\nreached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen \\nthrough at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have \\nshaken his conviction.\\n‘And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! \\nThe scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its \\neffect then. He had rushed to Porfiry…. But what had in -\\nduced the latter to receive him like that? What had been \\nhis object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must \\nhave some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It \\nwas true that a long time had passed since that morning—\\ntoo long a time—and no sight nor sound of Porfiry. Well, \\nthat was a bad sign….’\\nRaskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still \\npondering. It was the first time for a long while that he had \\nfelt clear in his mind, at least. ‘I must settle Svidrigaïlov,’ he \\nthought, ‘and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be wait -\\ning for me to come to him of my own accord.’ And at that \\nmoment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart \\nthat he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or \\nSvidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of do -\\ning it later, if not now.\\n‘We shall see, we shall see,’ he repeated to himself.\\nBut no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled \\nupon Porfiry himself in the passage. He was coming in to \\nsee him. Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but \\nonly for one minute. Strange to say, he was not very much \\nastonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him.

Come, I thought—even if I let one thing slip for a \\ntime, I shall get hold of something else—I shan’t lose what \\nI want, anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Roma -\\nnovitch, by temperament; it’s out of proportion with other \\nqualities of your heart and character, which I flatter myself \\nI have to some extent divined. Of course I did reflect even \\nthen that it does not always happen that a man gets up and \\nblurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you \\nmake a man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I \\nwas capable of realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, \\nthe least little fact to go upon, something I could lay hold \\nof, something tangible, not merely psychological. For if a \\nman is guilty, you must be able to get something substantial \\nout of him; one may reckon upon most surprising results \\nindeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Ro -\\nmanovitch, on your temperament above all things! I had \\ngreat hopes of you at that time.’\\n‘But what are you driving at now?’ Raskolnikov muttered \\nat last, asking the question without thinking.\\n‘What is he talking about?’ he wondered distractedly, \\n‘does he really take me to be innocent?’\\n‘What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I con -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180sider it my duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how \\nthe whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve \\ncaused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. \\nI am not a monster. I understand what it must mean for a \\nman who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperi -\\nous and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment! \\nI regard you in any case as a man of noble character and \\nnot without elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree \\nwith all your convictions. I wanted to tell you this first, \\nfrankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don’t want to de -\\nceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted \\nby you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a \\nright to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed \\nyou’ve no reason to like me.

I simply noted it at the time. What is there \\nin it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really noth -\\ning and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the \\nthing for the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by \\nnotions: here I have Nikolay on my hands with actual evi -\\ndence against him—you may think what you like of it, but \\nit’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one has to \\nconsider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why \\nam I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and \\nnot blame my malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was \\nnot malicious, I assure you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t \\ncome to search your room at the time? I did, I did, he-he! I \\nwas here when you were lying ill in bed, not officially, not in \\nmy own person, but I was here. Your room was searched to \\nthe last thread at the first suspicion; but umsonst ! I thought \\nto myself, now that man will come, will come of himself \\nand quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Anoth -\\ner man wouldn’t, but he will. And you remember how Mr. \\nRazumihin began discussing the subject with you? We ar -\\nranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread rumours, \\nthat he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin \\nis not a man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was \\ntremendously struck by your anger and your open daring. \\nThink of blurting out in a restaurant ‘I killed her.’ It was too \\ndaring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if he is guilty he \\nwill be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought at \\nthe time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Za -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commetov over and … well, you see, it all lies in this—that this \\ndamnable psychology can be taken two ways! Well, I kept \\nexpecting you, and so it was, you came! My heart was fairly \\nthrobbing. Ach!\\n‘Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as \\nyou came in, do you remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, \\nbut if I hadn’t expected you so specially, I should not have \\nnoticed anything in your laughter. You see what influence a \\nmood has! Mr. Razumihin then—ah, that stone, that stone \\nunder which the things were hidden! I seem to see it some -\\nwhere in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you \\ntold Zametov and afterwards you repeated that in my office? \\nAnd when we began picking your article to pieces, how you \\nexplained it! One could take every word of yours in two \\nsenses, as though there were another meaning hidden.\\n‘So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the fur -\\nthest limit, and knocking my head against a post, I pulled \\nmyself up, asking myself what I was about. After all, I said, \\nyou can take it all in another sense if you like, and it’s more \\nnatural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting it was more \\nnatural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some lit -\\ntle fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held \\nmy breath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ \\nthought I, and I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I \\nwould have given a thousand roubles at that minute to have \\nseen you with my own eyes, when you walked a hundred \\npaces beside that workman, after he had called you murder -\\ner to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question \\nall the way. And then what about your trembling, what Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18about your bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?\\n‘And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I \\nplayed such pranks on you? And what made you come at \\nthat very minute? Someone seemed to have sent you, by Jove! \\nAnd if Nikolay had not parted us … and do you remember \\nNikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was \\na thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! \\nI didn’t believe in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You \\ncould see it for yourself; and how could I? Even afterwards, \\nwhen you had gone and he began making very, very plausi -\\nble answers on certain points, so that I was surprised at him \\nmyself, even then I didn’t believe his story!

No, that’s not the \\nwork of a Nikolay, my dear Rodion Romanovitch!’\\nAll that had been said before had sounded so like a recan -\\ntation that these words were too great a shock.

Believe me, it will be better, \\nRodion Romanovitch.’\\nRaskolnikov smiled malignantly.\\n‘That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. \\nWhy, even if I were guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason \\nshould I have to confess, when you tell me yourself that I \\nshall be in greater safety in prison?’\\n‘Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in \\nwords, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place. \\nThat’s only theory and my theory, and what authority am \\nI for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfrom you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how can \\nyou ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would less -\\nen your sentence? You would be confessing at a moment \\nwhen another man has taken the crime on himself and so \\nhas muddled the whole case. Consider that! I swear before \\nGod that I will so arrange that your confession shall come \\nas a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all \\nthese psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so \\nthat your crime will appear to have been something like an \\naberration, for in truth it was an aberration. I am an honest \\nman, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word.’\\nRaskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his \\nhead sink dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last \\nsmiled again, but his smile was sad and gentle.\\n‘No!’ he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep \\nup appearances with Porfiry, ‘it’s not worth it, I don’t care \\nabout lessening the sentence!’\\n‘That’s just what I was afraid of!’ Porfiry cried warmly \\nand, as it seemed, involuntarily. ‘That’s just what I feared, \\nthat you wouldn’t care about the mitigation of sentence.’\\nRaskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.\\n‘Ah, don’t disdain life!’ Porfiry went on. ‘You have a great \\ndeal of it still before you. How can you say you don’t want a \\nmitigation of sentence? You are an impatient fellow!’\\n‘A great deal of what lies before me?’\\n‘Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much \\nabout it? Seek and ye shall find. This may be God’s means \\nfor bringing you to Him. And it’s not for ever, the bond -\\nage….’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘The time will be shortened,’ laughed Raskolnikov.\\n‘Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It \\nmay be that you are afraid of it without knowing it, because \\nyou are young! But anyway you shouldn’t be afraid of giving \\nyourself up and confessing.’\\n‘Ach, hang it!’ Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and \\ncontempt, as though he did not want to speak aloud.\\nHe got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat \\ndown again in evident despair.\\n‘Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that \\nI am grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? \\nHow much do you understand? You made up a theory and \\nthen were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be \\nnot at all original! It turned out something base, that’s true, \\nbut you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At \\nleast you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight \\nto the furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I \\nregard you as one of those men who would stand and smile \\nat their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they \\nhave found faith or God. Find it and you will live. You have \\nlong needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. \\nSuffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer. I know \\nyou don’t believe in it—but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself \\nstraight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid—the \\nflood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your \\nfeet again.

The evening will be fine, if only \\nwe don’t have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to \\nfreshen the air.’\\nHe, too, took his cap.\\n‘Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that \\nI have confessed to you to-day,’ Raskolnikov pronounced \\nwith sullen insistence. ‘You’re a strange man and I have \\nlistened to you from simple curiosity.

It \\nwill be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts \\nand sound decisions to you!’\\nPorfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Ras -\\nkolnikov. The latter went to the window and waited with Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18irritable impatience till he calculated that Porfiry had \\nreached the street and moved away. Then he too went hur -\\nriedly out of the room.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter III\\nHe hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from \\nthat man he did not know. But that man had some hid -\\nden power over him. Having once recognised this, he could \\nnot rest, and now the time had come.\\nOn the way, one question particularly worried him: had \\nSvidrigaïlov been to Porfiry’s?\\nAs far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had \\nnot. He pondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; \\nno, he hadn’t been, of course he hadn’t.\\nBut if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for \\nthe present he fancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have \\nexplained, but if he could, he would not have wasted much \\nthought over it at the moment. It all worried him and at the \\nsame time he could not attend to it. Strange to say, none \\nwould have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague \\nanxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more \\nimportant anxiety tormented him—it concerned himself, \\nbut in a different, more vital way. Moreover, he was con -\\nscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was \\nworking better that morning than it had done of late.\\nAnd was it worth while, after all that had happened, to \\ncontend with these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth \\nwhile, for instance, to manœuvre that Svidrigaïlov should \\nnot go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth while to investigate, to Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone like Svidriga -\\nïlov?\\nOh, how sick he was of it all!\\nAnd yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be ex -\\npecting something new from him, information, or means of \\nescape? Men will catch at straws! Was it destiny or some in -\\nstinct bringing them together? Perhaps it was only fatigue, \\ndespair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov but some other \\nwhom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented \\nhimself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia \\nfor now? To beg her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. \\nSonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence. He must \\ngo his own way or hers. At that moment especially he did \\nnot feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be better to try \\nSvidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that \\nhe had long felt that he must see him for some reason.\\nBut what could they have in common? Their very evil-\\ndoing could not be of the same kind. The man, moreover, \\nwas very unpleasant, evidently depraved, undoubtedly cun -\\nning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such stories were \\ntold about him.

He was \\nabout to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. \\nProspect, when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw \\nSvidrigaïlov, sitting at a tea-table right in the open window \\nwith a pipe in his mouth. Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken \\naback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov was silently watching \\nand scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov at once, \\nseemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved. \\nRaskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but \\nto be looking absent-mindedly away, while he watched him \\nout of the corner of his eye. His heart was beating violently. \\nYet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov did not want to be seen. \\nHe took the pipe out of his mouth and was on the point of \\nconcealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his \\nchair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Ras -\\nkolnikov had seen him, and was watching him. What had \\npassed between them was much the same as what happened \\nat their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A sly smile \\ncame into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and broader. \\nEach knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At \\nlast Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\\n‘Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!’ he shout -\\ned from the window.\\nRaskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svid -\\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrigaïlov in a tiny back room, adjoining the saloon in which \\nmerchants, clerks and numbers of people of all sorts were \\ndrinking tea at twenty little tables to the desperate bawl -\\ning of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls could \\nbe heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov \\nstood an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In \\nthe room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a \\nhealthy-looking red- cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a \\ntucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons. In \\nspite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some \\nservants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the ac -\\ncompaniment of the organ.\\n‘Come, that’s enough,’ Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Ras -\\nkolnikov’s entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood \\nwaiting respectfully. She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, \\nwith a serious and respectful expression in her face.\\n‘Hey, Philip, a glass!’ shouted Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘I won’t drink anything,’ said Raskolnikov.\\n‘As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t \\nwant anything more to-day, you can go.’ He poured her out \\na full glass, and laid down a yellow note.\\nKatia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without \\nputting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed \\nSvidrigaïlov’s hand, which he allowed quite seriously. She \\nwent out of the room and the boy trailed after her with \\nthe organ. Both had been brought in from the street. Svid -\\nrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything \\nabout him was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal foot -\\ning; the waiter, Philip, was by now an old friend and very Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18obsequious.\\nThe door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidriga -\\nïlov was at home in this room and perhaps spent whole days \\nin it. The tavern was dirty and wretched, not even second-\\nrate.\\n‘I was going to see you and looking for you,’ Raskol -\\nnikov began, ‘but I don’t know what made me turn from \\nthe Hay Market into the X. Prospect just now. I never take \\nthis turning. I turn to the right from the Hay Market. And \\nthis isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are. \\nIt is strange!’\\n‘Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?’\\n‘Because it may be only chance.’\\n‘Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,’ laughed Svidriga -\\nïlov. ‘You won’t admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a \\nmiracle! Here you say that it may be only chance. And what \\ncowards they all are here, about having an opinion of their \\nown, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I don’t mean \\nyou, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to \\nhave it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.’\\n‘Nothing else?’\\n‘Well, that’s enough, you know,’ Svidrigaïlov was obvi -\\nously exhilarated, but only slightly so, he had not had more \\nthan half a glass of wine.\\n‘I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was \\ncapable of having what you call an opinion of my own,’ ob -\\nserved Raskolnikov.\\n‘Oh, well, it was a different matter. everyone has his own \\nplans. And apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthink you have been asleep for the last two or three days. \\nI told you of this tavern myself, there is no miracle in your \\ncoming straight here. I explained the way myself, told you \\nwhere it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you \\nremember?’\\n‘I don’t remember,’ answered Raskolnikov with surprise.\\n‘I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been \\nstamped mechanically on your memory. You turned this \\nway mechanically and yet precisely according to the di -\\nrection, though you are not aware of it. When I told you \\nthen, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give your -\\nself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another \\nthing, I’m convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg \\nwho talk to themselves as they walk. This is a town of crazy \\npeople. If only we had scientific men, doctors, lawyers and \\nphilosophers might make most valuable investigations in \\nPetersburg each in his own line. There are few places where \\nthere are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on \\nthe soul of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of cli -\\nmate mean so much. And it’s the administrative centre of \\nall Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole \\ncountry. But that is neither here nor there now. The point \\nis that I have several times watched you. You walk out of \\nyour house—holding your head high—twenty paces from \\nhome you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back. \\nYou look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you. \\nAt last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, \\nand sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last \\nstand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18thing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it \\nwon’t do you any good. It’s nothing really to do with me and \\nI can’t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.’\\n‘Do you know that I am being followed?’ asked Raskol -\\nnikov, looking inquisitively at him.\\n‘No, I know nothing about it,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming \\nsurprised.\\n‘Well, then, let us leave me alone,’ Raskolnikov muttered, \\nfrowning.\\n‘Very good, let us leave you alone.’\\n‘You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and di -\\nrected me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and \\ntry to get away just now when I looked at the window from \\nthe street?

There are few places where \\nthere are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on \\nthe soul of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of cli -\\nmate mean so much. And it’s the administrative centre of \\nall Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole \\ncountry. But that is neither here nor there now. The point \\nis that I have several times watched you. You walk out of \\nyour house—holding your head high—twenty paces from \\nhome you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back. \\nYou look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you. \\nAt last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, \\nand sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last \\nstand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18thing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it \\nwon’t do you any good. It’s nothing really to do with me and \\nI can’t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.’\\n‘Do you know that I am being followed?’ asked Raskol -\\nnikov, looking inquisitively at him.\\n‘No, I know nothing about it,’ said Svidrigaïlov, seeming \\nsurprised.\\n‘Well, then, let us leave me alone,’ Raskolnikov muttered, \\nfrowning.\\n‘Very good, let us leave you alone.’\\n‘You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and di -\\nrected me twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and \\ntry to get away just now when I looked at the window from \\nthe street? I saw it.’\\n‘He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed \\neyes and pretended to be asleep, though you were wide \\nawake while I stood in your doorway? I saw it.’\\n‘I may have had … reasons. You know that yourself.’\\n‘And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know \\nthem.’\\nRaskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned \\nhis chin in the fingers of his right hand, and stared intent -\\nly at Svidrigaïlov. For a full minute he scrutinised his face, \\nwhich had impressed him before. It was a strange face, like \\na mask; white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen \\nbeard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow \\ntoo blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. \\nThere was something awfully unpleasant in that handsome \\nface, which looked so wonderfully young for his age. Svid -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light summer clothes and \\nwas particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge ring \\nwith a precious stone in it.\\n‘Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?’ said \\nRaskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience \\nstraight to the point. ‘Even though perhaps you are the most \\ndangerous man if you care to injure me, I don’t want to put \\nmyself out any more. I will show you at once that I don’t \\nprize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell \\nyou at once that if you keep to your former intentions with \\nregard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in \\nthat direction from what has been discovered of late, I will \\nkill you before you get me locked up. You can reckon on my \\nword. You know that I can keep it. And in the second place \\nif you want to tell me anything —for I keep fancying all \\nthis time that you have something to tell me—make haste \\nand tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon \\nbe too late.’\\n‘Why in such haste?’ asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him \\ncuriously.\\n‘Everyone has his plans,’ Raskolnikov answered gloomily \\nand impatiently.\\n‘You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the \\nfirst question you refuse to answer,’ Svidrigaïlov observed \\nwith a smile. ‘You keep fancying that I have aims of my own \\nand so you look at me with suspicion. Of course it’s perfect -\\nly natural in your position. But though I should like to be \\nfriends with you, I shan’t trouble myself to convince you of \\nthe contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I wasn’t Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18intending to talk to you about anything special.’\\n‘What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came \\nhanging about me.’\\n‘Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I \\nliked the fantastic nature of your position—that’s what it \\nwas! Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly in -\\nterested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a \\nvery great deal about you, from which I gathered that you \\nhad a great influence over her; isn’t that enough? Ha-ha-ha! \\nStill I must admit that your question is rather complex, and \\nis difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have \\ncome to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of \\nhearing something new. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?’ persist -\\ned Svidrigaïlov with a sly smile. ‘Well, can’t you fancy then \\nthat I, too, on my way here in the train was reckoning on \\nyou, on your telling me something new, and on my making \\nsome profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!’\\n‘What profit could you make?’\\n‘How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what \\na tavern I spend all my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s \\nto say it’s no great enjoyment, but one must sit somewhere; \\nthat poor Katia now—you saw her? … If only I had been a \\nglutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.’\\nHe pointed to a little table in the corner where the rem -\\nnants of a terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a \\ntin dish.\\n‘Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and \\nwant nothing more. I don’t drink, for instance, at all. Ex -\\ncept for champagne I never touch anything, and not more \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthan a glass of that all the evening, and even that is enough \\nto make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind my -\\nself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me \\nin a peculiar state of mind.

You seem to find something wrong in my speak -\\ning like that about women?’\\n‘You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?’\\n‘Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you \\nin order, first about women in general; you know I am fond \\nof talking. Tell me, what should I restrain myself for?

I spent seven years in the coun -\\ntry with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an \\nintelligent person like you—intelligent and highly interest -\\ning—I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that \\nhalf-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. \\nAnd besides, there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tre -\\nmendously, but about that I … will keep quiet.

If \\nyou like I’ll tell you how a woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you \\nwould call it? It will be an answer to your first question in -\\ndeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will \\nhelp to spend the time.’\\n‘Tell me, but I trust that you …’\\n‘Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low \\nfellow like me, Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the \\ndeepest respect.’\\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IV\\n‘You know perhaps—yes, I told you myself,’ began Svid -\\nrigaïlov, ‘that I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an \\nimmense sum, and had not any expectation of being able \\nto pay it. There’s no need to go into particulars how Marfa \\nPetrovna bought me out; do you know to what a point of \\ninsanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest \\nwoman, and very sensible, although completely uneducat -\\ned. Would you believe that this honest and jealous woman, \\nafter many scenes of hysterics and reproaches, condescend -\\ned to enter into a kind of contract with me which she kept \\nthroughout our married life? She was considerably older \\nthan I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something \\nin her mouth. There was so much swinishness in my soul \\nand honesty too, of a sort, as to tell her straight out that I \\ncouldn’t be absolutely faithful to her. This confession drove \\nher to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have liked my \\nbrutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling \\nto deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for \\na jealous woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. \\nAfter many tears an unwritten contract was drawn up be -\\ntween us: first, that I would never leave Marfa Petrovna and \\nwould always be her husband; secondly, that I would never \\nabsent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would \\nnever set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18this, Marfa Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maid -\\nservants, but only with her secret knowledge; fifthly, God \\nforbid my falling in love with a woman of our class; sixthly, \\nin case I—which God forbid—should be visited by a great \\nserious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. \\nOn this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at \\nease. She was a sensible woman and so she could not help \\nlooking upon me as a dissolute profligate incapable of real \\nlove. But a sensible woman and a jealous woman are two \\nvery different things, and that’s where the trouble came in. \\nBut to judge some people impartially we must renounce \\ncertain preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to \\nthe ordinary people about us. I have reason to have faith in \\nyour judgment rather than in anyone’s. Perhaps you have \\nalready heard a great deal that was ridiculous and absurd \\nabout Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very ridicu -\\nlous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for \\nthe innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and \\nthat’s enough, I think, by way of a decorous oraison funèbre  \\nfor the most tender wife of a most tender husband.

I see that you, too, are extremely interested \\nand shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first \\nopportunity. Upon my soul! I see that I really might pass \\nfor a romantic figure with some people. Judge how grateful \\nI must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya \\nRomanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about \\nme. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but \\nin any case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Ro -\\nmanovna’s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably \\ngloomy and repellent aspect—she did at least feel pity for \\nme, pity for a lost soul. And if once a girl’s heart is moved \\nto pity it’s more dangerous than anything. She is bound to \\nwant to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift him \\nup and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new \\nlife and usefulness—well, we all know how far such dreams \\ncan go. I saw at once that the bird was flying into the cage \\nof herself. And I too made ready. I think you are frowning, \\nRodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you know, it all \\nended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!) Do \\nyou know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that \\nit wasn’t your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third \\ncentury A.D., as the daughter of a reigning prince or some \\ngovernor or pro-consul in Asia Minor. She would undoubt -\\nedly have been one of those who would endure martyrdom \\nand would have smiled when they branded her bosom with \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhot pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And \\nin the fourth or fifth century she would have walked away \\ninto the Egyptian desert and would have stayed there thirty \\nyears living on roots and ecstasies and visions. She is simply \\nthirsting to face some torture for someone, and if she can’t \\nget her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve \\nheard something of a Mr. Razumihin—he’s said to be a sen -\\nsible fellow; his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably \\na divinity student. Well, he’d better look after your sister! \\nI believe I understand her, and I am proud of it. But at the \\nbeginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one is apt to \\nbe more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang \\nit all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it \\nbegan on my side with a most irresistible physical desire. \\nAvdotya Romanovna is awfully chaste, incredibly and phe -\\nnomenally so. Take note, I tell you this about your sister as \\na fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in spite of her broad \\nintelligence, and it will stand in her way. There happened \\nto be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, \\nwhom I had never seen before—she had just come from an -\\nother village—very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst \\ninto tears, wailed so that she could be heard all over the \\nplace and caused scandal. One day after dinner Avdotya \\nRomanovna followed me into an avenue in the garden and \\nwith flashing eyes insisted  on my leaving poor Parasha \\nalone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, \\nof course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to \\nappear disconcerted, embarrassed, in fact played my part \\nnot badly. Then came interviews, mysterious conversations, Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears—would \\nyou believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for pro -\\npaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on \\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and \\nfinally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjec -\\ntion of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s \\nthe well-known resource—flattery. Nothing in the world is \\nharder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flat -\\ntery. If there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking \\nthe truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But \\nif all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, \\nand is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse \\nsatisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the \\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for \\nall stages of development and classes of society. A vestal \\nvirgin might be seduced by flattery. I can never remember \\nwithout laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devot -\\ned to her husband, her children, and her principles. What \\nfun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really had \\nprinciples—of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply \\nbeing utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I \\nflattered her shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in get -\\nting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would \\nreproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would \\ndeclare that she had resisted, so that I could never have \\ngained anything but for my being so unprincipled. I main -\\ntained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee \\nmy treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, \\nand so on. In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfirmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful \\nto all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite \\nby accident. And how angry she was with me when I ex -\\nplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that \\nshe was just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully \\nweak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I \\nmight have had all her property settled on me during her \\nlifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talk -\\ning too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now \\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya \\nRomanovna.

Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how'), Document(page_content='paganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on \\nmy destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and \\nfinally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjec -\\ntion of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s \\nthe well-known resource—flattery. Nothing in the world is \\nharder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flat -\\ntery. If there’s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking \\nthe truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But \\nif all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, \\nand is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse \\nsatisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the \\nflattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for \\nall stages of development and classes of society. A vestal \\nvirgin might be seduced by flattery. I can never remember \\nwithout laughter how I once seduced a lady who was devot -\\ned to her husband, her children, and her principles. What \\nfun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really had \\nprinciples—of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply \\nbeing utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I \\nflattered her shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in get -\\nting a pressure of the hand, even a glance from her, I would \\nreproach myself for having snatched it by force, and would \\ndeclare that she had resisted, so that I could never have \\ngained anything but for my being so unprincipled. I main -\\ntained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee \\nmy treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, \\nand so on. In fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfirmly convinced that she was innocent, chaste, and faithful \\nto all her duties and obligations and had succumbed quite \\nby accident. And how angry she was with me when I ex -\\nplained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that \\nshe was just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully \\nweak on the side of flattery, and if I had only cared to, I \\nmight have had all her property settled on me during her \\nlifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine now and talk -\\ning too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now \\nthat I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya \\nRomanovna. But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it \\nall. Avdotya Romanovna had several times—and one time \\nin particular—been greatly displeased by the expression of \\nmy eyes, would you believe it?

Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how \\nyour sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my be -\\ning drunk at this moment and having had a whole glass of \\nwine. I am speaking the truth. I assure you that this glance \\nhas haunted my dreams; the very rustle of her dress was \\nmore than I could stand at last. I really began to think that \\nI might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I \\ncould be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to \\nbe reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And imagine Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18what I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be \\nbrought by frenzy! Never undertake anything in a frenzy, \\nRodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna \\nwas after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word \\n… but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she \\nlived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep \\n(ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and I resolved to \\noffer her all my money—thirty thousand roubles I could \\nhave realised then—if she would run away with me here, \\nto Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love, \\nrapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her \\nat that time that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petro -\\nvna or to cut her throat and to marry herself, it would have \\nbeen done at once! But it ended in the catastrophe of which \\nyou know already. You can fancy how frantic I was when I \\nheard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly \\nattorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between \\nthem—which would really have been just the same thing \\nas I was proposing. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t it? I notice that \\nyou’ve begun to be very attentive … you interesting young \\nman….’\\nSvidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. \\nHe was flushed.

I’ve drunk too much \\nthough, I see that. I was almost saying too much again. \\nDamn the wine!

The \\npeasants have vodka, the educated young people, shut out \\nfrom activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams and \\nvisions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up \\nand are amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up \\nto debauchery. From the first hour the town reeked of its fa -\\nmiliar odours.

Yes, there you have progress. \\nAll of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely dressed, \\ndancing with a specialist in that line, with another one vis-\\nà-vis .

Her partner Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18seized her and began whirling her round and performing \\nbefore her; everyone laughed and—I like your public, even \\nthe cancan  public—they laughed and shouted, ‘Serves her \\nright— serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well, \\nit’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was \\nlogical or not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the \\nmother, and began by saying that I too was a stranger and \\nthat people here were ill-bred and that they couldn’t distin -\\nguish decent folks and treat them with respect, gave her to \\nunderstand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them \\nhome in my carriage.

Why are you frightened like a \\nchild? Am I really so terrible?’\\nSvidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending \\nsmile; but he was in no smiling mood. His heart was throb -\\nbing and he could scarcely breathe. He spoke rather loud to \\ncover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not notice \\nthis peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark \\nthat she was frightened of him like a child and that he was \\nso terrible to her.\\n‘Though I know that you are not a man … of honour, I \\nam not in the least afraid of you.

Yet \\nthere was something to observe, for instance, that Svidriga -\\nïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited \\napartments. His rooms were not entered directly from the \\npassage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty \\nrooms. Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svid -\\nrigaïlov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to \\nlet. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she \\nwas called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to ex -\\nplain.\\n‘Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, \\nit’s locked.

It’s galling too, of course, for a young \\nman of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, \\nfor instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his \\nwhole future would be differently shaped and yet not to \\nhave that three thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability \\nfrom hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid \\nsense of the charm of his social position and his sister’s and \\nmother’s position too.

He has suffered a great deal and \\nis still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, \\nbut was incapable of boldly overstepping the law, and so he \\nis not a man of genius.

His still trem -\\nbling lips slowly broke into an angry mocking smile.\\n‘There is no one at home,’ he said quietly and emphatical -\\nly. ‘The landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout \\nlike that. You are only exciting yourself uselessly.’\\n‘Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base \\nman!’\\n‘I have lost the key and cannot find it.’\\n‘This is an outrage,’ cried Dounia, turning pale as death. \\nShe rushed to the furthest corner, where she made haste to \\nbarricade herself with a little table.\\nShe did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormen -\\ntor and watched every movement he made.\\nSvidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the \\nroom facing her. He was positively composed, at least in \\nappearance, but his face was pale as before. The mocking Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18smile did not leave his face.\\n‘You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. \\nIn that case you may be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya \\nSemyonovna is not at home. The Kapernaumovs are far \\naway—there are five locked rooms between. I am at least \\ntwice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides. \\nFor you could not complain afterwards. You surely would \\nnot be willing actually to betray your brother? Besides, no \\none would believe you. How should a girl have come alone \\nto visit a solitary man in his lodgings? So that even if you \\ndo sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing. It is very \\ndifficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.’\\n‘Scoundrel!’ whispered Dounia indignantly.\\n‘As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of \\na general proposition. It’s my personal conviction that you \\nare perfectly right —violence is hateful. I only spoke to show \\nyou that you need have no remorse even if … you were will -\\ning to save your brother of your own accord, as I suggest to \\nyou. You would be simply submitting to circumstances, to \\nviolence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think about it. \\nYour brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I \\nwill be your slave … all my life … I will wait here.’\\nSvidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from \\nDounia. She had not the slightest doubt now of his unbend -\\ning determination. Besides, she knew him. Suddenly she \\npulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it and laid it in \\nher hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.\\n‘Aha! So that’s it, is it?’ he cried, surprised but smil -\\ning maliciously. ‘Well, that completely alters the aspect of \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comaffairs. You’ve made things wonderfully easier for me, Av -\\ndotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was \\nit Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend! And \\nhow I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you \\nin the country have not been thrown away.’\\n‘It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, \\nwhom you killed, wretch! There was nothing of yours in her \\nhouse. I took it when I began to suspect what you were ca -\\npable of. If you dare to advance one step, I swear I’ll kill you.’ \\nShe was frantic.\\n‘But your brother? I ask from curiosity,’ said Svidrigaïlov, \\nstill standing where he was.\\n‘Inform, if you want to!

Never?’ he whispered in despair.\\n‘Never!’\\nThere followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in \\nthe heart of Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescrib -\\nable gaze. Suddenly he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to \\nthe window and stood facing it. Another moment passed.\\n‘Here’s the key.’Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on \\nthe table behind him, without turning or looking at Dou -\\nnia.\\n‘Take it! Make haste!’\\nHe looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went \\nup to the table to take the key.\\n‘Make haste! Make haste!’ repeated Svidrigaïlov, still \\nwithout turning or moving. But there seemed a terrible sig -\\nnificance in the tone of that ‘make haste.’\\nDounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the \\ndoor, unlocked it quickly and rushed out of the room. A \\nminute later, beside herself, she ran out on to the canal bank \\nin the direction of X. Bridge.\\nSvidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the \\nwindow. At last he slowly turned, looked about him and \\npassed his hand over his forehead. A strange smile con -\\ntorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of despair. \\nThe blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand. \\nHe looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his \\ntemple. The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near \\nthe door and suddenly caught his eye. He picked it up and \\nexamined it. It was a little pocket three-barrel revolver of \\nold-fashioned construction. There were still two charges \\nand one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He thought \\na little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went \\nout.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter VI\\nHe spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low \\nhaunt to another. Katia too turned up and sang an -\\nother gutter song, how a certain ‘villain and tyrant began \\nkissing Katia.’\\nSvidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and \\nsome singers and the waiters and two little clerks. He was \\nparticularly drawn to these clerks by the fact that they both \\nhad crooked noses, one bent to the left and the other to the \\nright. They took him finally to a pleasure garden, where he \\npaid for their entrance. There was one lanky three- year-old \\npine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a ‘Vaux -\\nhall,’ which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was \\nserved, and there were a few green tables and chairs stand -\\ning round it. A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken \\nbut exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich \\nwith a red nose entertained the public. The clerks quarrelled \\nwith some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent. Svid -\\nrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to \\nthem for a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that \\nthere was no possibility of understanding them.

The rain still persisted. Drenched to \\nthe skin, he walked into the little flat where the parents \\nof his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky Is -\\nland. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and \\nhis visit at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov \\ncould be very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, \\nand indeed very intelligent surmise of the sensible parents \\nthat Svidrigaïlov had probably had so much to drink that \\nhe did not know what he was doing vanished immediate -\\nly. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see Svidrigaïlov \\nby the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the \\nconversation with various irrelevant questions. She never \\nasked a direct question, but began by smiling and rubbing \\nher hands and then, if she were obliged to ascertain some -\\nthing—for instance, when Svidrigaïlov would like to have \\nthe wedding—she would begin by interested and almost ea -\\nger questions about Paris and the court life there, and only \\nby degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. \\nOn other occasions this had of course been very impressive, \\nbut this time Arkady Ivanovitch seemed particularly impa -\\ntient, and insisted on seeing his betrothed at once, though \\nhe had been informed, to begin with, that she had already \\ngone to bed.

He went away, leaving them all in \\na state of extraordinary excitement, but the tender mam -\\nma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of the \\nmost important of their doubts, concluding that Svidriga -\\nïlov was a great man, a man of great affairs and connections \\nand of great wealth—there was no knowing what he had \\nin his mind.

The \\nlatter, scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18led him at once to a close and tiny room in the distance, at \\nthe end of the corridor, under the stairs. There was no other, \\nall were occupied. The ragged fellow looked inquiringly.\\n‘Is there tea?’ asked Svidrigaïlov.\\n‘Yes, sir.’\\n‘What else is there?’\\n‘Veal, vodka, savouries.’\\n‘Bring me tea and veal.’\\n‘And you want nothing else?’ he asked with apparent sur -\\nprise.\\n‘Nothing, nothing.’\\nThe ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\\n‘It must be a nice place,’ thought Svidrigaïlov. ‘How was \\nit I didn’t know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café \\nchantant and have had some adventure on the way. It would \\nbe interesting to know who stay here?’\\nHe lighted the candle and looked at the room more care -\\nfully. It was a room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could \\nonly just stand up in it; it had one window; the bed, which \\nwas very dirty, and the plain- stained chair and table almost \\nfilled it up. The walls looked as though they were made of \\nplanks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty that \\nthe pattern was indistinguishable, though the general co -\\nlour—yellow—could still be made out. One of the walls was \\ncut short by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not \\nan attic but just under the stairs.\\nSvidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed \\nand sank into thought. But a strange persistent murmur \\nwhich sometimes rose to a shout in the next room attracted \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comhis attention. The murmur had not ceased from the moment \\nhe entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding \\nand almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\\nSvidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and \\nat once he saw light through a crack in the wall; he went \\nup and peeped through. The room, which was somewhat \\nlarger than his, had two occupants. One of them, a very \\ncurly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing \\nin the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide \\napart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the \\nbreast. He reproached the other with being a beggar, with \\nhaving no standing whatever. He declared that he had tak -\\nen the other out of the gutter and he could turn him out \\nwhen he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it \\nall. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and \\nhad the air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but \\ncan’t. He sometimes turned sheepish and befogged eyes on \\nthe speaker, but obviously had not the slightest idea what \\nhe was talking about and scarcely heard it. A candle was \\nburning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a near -\\nly empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses \\nwith the dregs of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, \\nSvidrigaïlov turned away indifferently and sat down on the \\nbed.\\nThe ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not \\nresist asking him again whether he didn’t want anything \\nmore, and again receiving a negative reply, finally withdrew. \\nSvidrigaïlov made haste to drink a glass of tea to warm him -\\nself, but could not eat anything. He began to feel feverish. Crime and Punishment \\x180\\x18He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the blanket, \\nlay down on the bed. He was annoyed. ‘It would have been \\nbetter to be well for the occasion,’ he thought with a smile. \\nThe room was close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was \\nroaring outside, he heard a mouse scratching in the corner \\nand the room smelt of mice and of leather. He lay in a sort \\nof reverie: one thought followed another. He felt a longing \\nto fix his imagination on something. ‘It must be a garden \\nunder the window,’ he thought. ‘There’s a sound of trees. \\nHow I dislike the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the \\ndark! They give one a horrid feeling.’ He remembered how \\nhe had disliked it when he passed Petrovsky Park just now. \\nThis reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he \\nfelt cold again as he had when standing there. ‘I never have \\nliked water,’ he thought, ‘even in a landscape,’ and he sud -\\ndenly smiled again at a strange idea: ‘Surely now all these \\nquestions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve \\nbecome more particular, like an animal that picks out a spe -\\ncial place … for such an occasion. I ought to have gone into \\nthe Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold, ha-ha! \\nAs though I were seeking pleasant sensations! … By the way, \\nwhy haven’t I put out the candle?’ he blew it out. ‘They’ve \\ngone to bed next door,’ he thought, not seeing the light at \\nthe crack. ‘Well, now, Marfa Petrovna, now is the time for \\nyou to turn up; it’s dark, and the very time and place for you. \\nBut now you won’t come!’\\nHe suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out \\nhis design on Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov \\nto trust her to Razumihin’s keeping. ‘I suppose I really did \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comsay it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to tease myself.

By degrees Dounia’s image \\nrose before him, and a shudder ran over him. ‘No, I must \\ngive up all that now,’ he thought, rousing himself. ‘I must \\nthink of something else. It’s queer and funny.

He shook the blanket and suddenly \\na mouse jumped out on the sheet. He tried to catch it, but \\nthe mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without leaving the bed, \\nslipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and suddenly \\ndarted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in \\none instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over \\nhis body and down his back under his shirt. He trembled \\nnervously and woke up.\\nThe room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped \\nup in the blanket as before. The wind was howling under \\nthe window. ‘How disgusting,’ he thought with annoyance.\\nHe got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his \\nback to the window. ‘It’s better not to sleep at all,’ he de -\\ncided. There was a cold damp draught from the window, \\nhowever; without getting up he drew the blanket over him \\nand wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of anything \\nand did not want to think. But one image rose after anoth -\\ner, incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end \\npassed through his mind. He sank into drowsiness. Per -\\nhaps the cold, or the dampness, or the dark, or the wind \\nthat howled under the window and tossed the trees roused a \\nsort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling \\non images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, \\na bright, warm, almost hot day, a holiday—Trinity day. A \\x180\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comfine, sumptuous country cottage in the English taste over -\\ngrown with fragrant flowers, with flower beds going round \\nthe house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was surrounded \\nwith beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with rich \\nrugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He no -\\nticed particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, \\nheavily fragrant narcissus bending over their bright, green, \\nthick long stalks. He was reluctant to move away from \\nthem, but he went up the stairs and came into a large, high \\ndrawing-room and again everywhere—at the windows, the \\ndoors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself—were \\nflowers. The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant \\nhay, the windows were open, a fresh, cool, light air came \\ninto the room. The birds were chirruping under the win -\\ndow, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with \\na white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was covered \\nwith white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths \\nof flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers \\nlay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed \\nand pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble. \\nBut her loose fair hair was wet; there was a wreath of roses \\non her head. The stern and already rigid profile of her face \\nlooked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on \\nher pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and \\nsorrowful appeal. Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no \\nholy image, no burning candle beside the coffin; no sound \\nof prayers: the girl had drowned herself. She was only four -\\nteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed \\nherself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed Crime and Punishment \\x1810that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with un -\\nmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, \\nunheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the \\ncold and wet while the wind howled….\\nSvidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and \\nwent to the window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The \\nwind lashed furiously into the little room and stung his face \\nand his chest, only covered with his shirt, as though with \\nfrost. Under the window there must have been something \\nlike a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too, \\nprobably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. \\nNow drops of rain flew in at the window from the trees and \\nbushes; it was dark as in a cellar, so that he could only just \\nmake out some dark blurs of objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending \\ndown with elbows on the window-sill, gazed for five min -\\nutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed by a \\nsecond one, resounded in the darkness of the night. ‘Ah, the \\nsignal! The river is overflowing,’ he thought. ‘By morning it \\nwill be swirling down the street in the lower parts, flood -\\ning the basements and cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, \\nand men will curse in the rain and wind as they drag their \\nrubbish to their upper storeys. What time is it now?’ And he \\nhad hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on the \\nwall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\\n‘Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out \\nat once straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there \\ndrenched with rain, so that as soon as one’s shoulder touch -\\nes it, millions of drops drip on one’s head.’\\nHe moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the \\x1811 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcandle, put on his waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and \\nwent out, carrying the candle, into the passage to look for \\nthe ragged attendant who would be asleep somewhere in \\nthe midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay \\nhim for the room and leave the hotel. ‘It’s the best minute; I \\ncouldn’t choose a better.’\\nHe walked for some time through a long narrow corridor \\nwithout finding anyone and was just going to call out, when \\nsuddenly in a dark corner between an old cupboard and the \\ndoor he caught sight of a strange object which seemed to \\nbe alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little girl, \\nnot more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her \\nclothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem \\nafraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amaze -\\nment out of her big black eyes.

The torn shoes which she had on her \\nstockingless feet were as wet as if they had been standing in \\na puddle all night. When he had undressed her, he put her \\non the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in the blanket \\nfrom her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he \\nsank into dreary musing again.\\n‘What folly to trouble myself,’ he decided suddenly with \\nan oppressive feeling of annoyance. ‘What idiocy!’ In vexa -\\ntion he took up the candle to go and look for the ragged \\nattendant again and make haste to go away. ‘Damn the child!’ \\nhe thought as he opened the door, but he turned again to see \\nwhether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket careful -\\nly. The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under \\nthe blanket, and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange \\nto say that flush seemed brighter and coarser than the rosy \\ncheeks of childhood. ‘It’s a flush of fever,’ thought Svidriga -\\nïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as though she had \\nbeen given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were hot \\nand glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that \\nher long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids \\nwere opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an un -\\nchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but \\npretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in a smile. The \\ncorners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now \\nit was a grin, a broad grin; there was something shameless, \\nprovocative in that quite unchildish face; it was depravity, \\nit was the face of a harlot, the shameless face of a French \\nharlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they turned a glowing, \\nshameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited him…. \\nThere was something infinitely hideous and shocking in \\nthat laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of \\na child. ‘What, at five years old?’ Svidrigaïlov muttered in \\ngenuine horror. ‘What does it mean?’ And now she turned \\nto him, her little face all aglow, holding out her arms…. ‘Ac -\\ncursed child!’ Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand to strike \\nher, but at that moment he woke up.\\nHe was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The \\ncandle had not been lighted, and daylight was streaming in \\nat the windows.\\n‘I’ve had nightmare all night!’ He got up angrily, feeling \\nutterly shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist \\noutside and he could see nothing. It was nearly five. He had \\noverslept himself! He got up, put on his still damp jacket \\nand overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his pocket, he took it \\nout and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his pocket \\nand in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote \\na few lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into \\nthought with his elbows on the table. The revolver and the \\nnotebook lay beside him. Some flies woke up and settled on \\nthe untouched veal, which was still on the table. He stared \\nat them and at last with his free right hand began trying \\nto catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18it. At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting \\npursuit, he started, got up and walked resolutely out of the \\nroom. A minute later he was in the street.\\nA thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov \\nwalked along the slippery dirty wooden pavement to -\\nwards the Little Neva. He was picturing the waters of the \\nLittle Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island, the wet \\npaths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the \\nbush…. He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, try -\\ning to think of something else. There was not a cabman or \\na passer-by in the street. The bright yellow, wooden, little \\nhouses looked dirty and dejected with their closed shutters. \\nThe cold and damp penetrated his whole body and he be -\\ngan to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs \\nand read each carefully. At last he reached the end of the \\nwooden pavement and came to a big stone house. A dirty, \\nshivering dog crossed his path with its tail between its \\nlegs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead drunk, \\nacross the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high \\ntower stood up on the left. ‘Bah!’ he shouted, ‘here is a place. \\nWhy should it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an \\nofficial witness anyway….’\\nHe almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the \\nstreet where there was the big house with the tower. At the \\ngreat closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his \\nshoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier’s \\ncoat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head. He cast a \\ndrowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov.

They \\nboth, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a \\nfew minutes without speaking.

His face was almost distorted \\nfrom fatigue, exposure, the inward conflict that had lasted \\nfor twenty-four hours. He had spent all the previous night \\nalone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a de -\\ncision.\\nHe knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. \\nDounia was not at home. Even the servant happened to be \\nout. At first Pulcheria Alexandrovna was speechless with \\njoy and surprise; then she took him by the hand and drew \\nhim into the room.\\n‘Here you are!’ she began, faltering with joy. ‘Don’t be \\nangry with me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with \\ntears: I am laughing not crying. Did you think I was crying? \\nNo, I am delighted, but I’ve got into such a stupid habit of \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comshedding tears. I’ve been like that ever since your father’s \\ndeath. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you must be \\ntired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.’\\n‘I was in the rain yesterday, mother….’ Raskolnikov be -\\ngan.\\n‘No, no,’ Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupt -\\ned, ‘you thought I was going to cross-question you in the \\nwomanish way I used to; don’t be anxious, I understand, I \\nunderstand it all: now I’ve learned the ways here and truly \\nI see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my mind \\nonce for all: how could I understand your plans and expect \\nyou to give an account of them? God knows what concerns \\nand plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; \\nso it’s not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you \\nwhat you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why am I \\nrunning to and fro as though I were crazy … ? I am read -\\ning your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. \\nDmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried \\nout to myself: ‘There, foolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he \\nis busy about; that’s the solution of the mystery! Learned \\npeople are always like that. He may have some new ideas \\nin his head just now; he is thinking them over and I worry \\nhim and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there \\nwas a great deal I did not understand; but that’s only natu -\\nral—how should I?’\\n‘Show me, mother.’\\nRaskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his \\narticle. Incongruous as it was with his mood and his cir -\\ncumstances, he felt that strange and bitter sweet sensation Crime and Punishment \\x181\\x18that every author experiences the first time he sees himself \\nin print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only a \\nmoment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart \\nthrobbed with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict \\nof the preceding months. He flung the article on the table \\nwith disgust and anger.\\n‘But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for my -\\nself that you will very soon be one of the leading—if not the \\nleading man—in the world of Russian thought. And they \\ndared to think you were mad! You don’t know, but they re -\\nally thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures, how could \\nthey understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but \\nbelieving it—what do you say to that? Your father sent twice \\nto magazines—the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript \\nand will show you) and the second time a whole novel (I \\nbegged him to let me copy it out) and how we prayed that \\nthey should be taken—they weren’t! I was breaking my \\nheart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your \\nclothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how \\nfoolish I was, for you can attain any position you like by \\nyour intellect and talent.

I don’t say that Dounia is very wanting in consid -\\neration. I am not complaining. She has her ways and I have \\x181\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.commine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and I never \\nhave any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that \\nDounia has far too much sense, and besides she loves you \\nand me … but I don’t know what it will all lead to. You’ve \\nmade me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she has \\nmissed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell her: \\n‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you \\nbeen all this time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; \\ncome when you can, but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can \\nwait.

Oh, God, what are we doing?’\\nYes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one \\nthere, that he was alone with his mother. For the first time \\nafter all those awful months his heart was softened. He fell \\ndown before her, he kissed her feet and both wept, embrac -\\ning. And she was not surprised and did not question him \\nthis time. For some days she had realised that something \\nawful was happening to her son and that now some terrible \\nminute had come for him.\\n‘Rodya, my darling, my first born,’ she said sobbing, ‘now \\nyou are just as when you were little.

Some post or career for \\nyou?’\\n‘What God sends … only pray for me.’ Raskolnikov went \\nto the door, but she clutched him and gazed despairingly \\ninto his eyes.

You’ll come, you’ll \\ncome to-morrow?’\\n‘I will, I will, good-bye.’ He tore himself away at last.\\nIt was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up \\nin the morning. Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made \\nhaste. He wanted to finish all before sunset. He did not want \\nto meet anyone till then. Going up the stairs he noticed that \\nNastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently. \\n‘Can anyone have come to see me?’ he wondered. He had \\na disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw \\nDounia. She was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, \\nand looked as though she had been waiting a long time. He \\nstopped short in the doorway. She rose from the sofa in dis -\\nmay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him, \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.combetrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes \\nalone he saw at once that she knew.\\n‘Am I to come in or go away?’ he asked uncertainly.\\n‘I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both \\nwaiting for you. We thought that you would be sure to come \\nthere.’\\nRaskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on \\na chair.\\n‘I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have \\nliked at this moment to be able to control myself.’\\nHe glanced at her mistrustfully.\\n‘Where were you all night?’\\n‘I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to \\nmake up my mind once for all, and several times I walked \\nby the Neva, I remember that I wanted to end it all there, \\nbut … I couldn’t make up my mind,’ he whispered, looking \\nat her mistrustfully again.\\n‘Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya \\nSemyonovna and I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank \\nGod, thank God!’\\nRaskolnikov smiled bitterly.\\n‘I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s \\narms; I haven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. \\nI don’t know how it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.’\\n‘Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?’ cried \\nDounia, horror- stricken. ‘Surely you haven’t done that?’\\n‘No, I didn’t tell her … in words; but she understood a \\ngreat deal. She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure \\nshe half understands it already. Perhaps I did wrong in go -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18ing to see her. I don’t know why I did go.

Yes, to escape the disgrace I \\nthought of drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into \\nthe water, I thought that if I had considered myself strong \\ntill now I’d better not be afraid of disgrace,’ he said, hurry -\\ning on. ‘It’s pride, Dounia.’\\n‘Pride, Rodya.’\\nThere was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed \\nto be glad to think that he was still proud.\\n‘You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the wa -\\nter?’ he asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.\\n‘Oh, Rodya, hush!’ cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted \\nfor two minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; \\nDounia stood at the other end of the table and looked at \\nhim with anguish. Suddenly he got up.\\n‘It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself \\nup. But I don’t know why I am going to give myself up.’\\nBig tears fell down her cheeks.\\n‘You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand \\nto me?’\\n‘You doubted it?’\\nShe threw her arms round him.\\n‘Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffer -\\ning?’ she cried, holding him close and kissing him.\\n‘Crime?

Dounia did not ask, but \\nshe knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever -\\nence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was \\nalmost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, \\nhardly worthy to look at Dounia.

When she had gone, Sonia \\nbegan to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, \\nand Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying \\nto persuade each other that that could not be, and both were Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180less anxious while they were together.

All day Sonia had been waiting for him in ter -\\nrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had \\ncome to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov’s \\nwords that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conver -\\nsation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they \\nbecame. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that in -\\nterview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone \\nto her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her \\nfor human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with \\nhim wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but \\nshe knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with rever -\\nence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was \\nalmost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, \\nhardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image \\nwhen she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at \\ntheir first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had remained in \\nher mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.\\nDounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went \\nto her brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking \\nthat he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia \\nbegan to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, \\nand Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying \\nto persuade each other that that could not be, and both were Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180less anxious while they were together.

At last when she began to feel sure of his \\ndeath—he walked into the room.\\nShe gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face \\nshe turned pale.\\n‘Yes,’ said Raskolnikov, smiling. ‘I have come for your \\ncross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; \\nwhy is it you are frightened now it’s come to that?’\\nSonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange \\nto her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she \\nguessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke \\nto her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.\\n‘You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. \\nThere is one fact…. But it’s a long story and there’s no need \\nto discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys \\nme that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me \\ndirectly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which \\nI shall have to answer—they’ll point their fingers at me…. \\nTfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. \\nI’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comI shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I \\nmust be cooler; I’ve become too irritable of late. You know I \\nwas nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she \\nturned to take a last look at me. It’s a brutal state to be in! \\nAh! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’\\nHe seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could \\nnot stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his \\nideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoher -\\nently, his hands trembled slightly.\\nWithout a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, \\none of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign \\nof the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden \\ncross on his neck.\\n‘It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,’ he laughed. \\n‘As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden \\ncross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizave -\\nta’s—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on … at \\nthat moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver \\none and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old wom -\\nan’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are \\nwhat I ought to put on now…. But I am talking nonsense \\nand forgetting what matters; I’m somehow forgetful…. You \\nsee I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know \\n… that’s all— that’s all I came for. But I thought I had more \\nto say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going \\nto prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you cry -\\ning for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!’\\nBut his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked \\nat her. ‘Why is she grieving too?’ he thought to himself. Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18‘What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking \\nafter me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’\\n‘Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,’ Sonia begged in a \\ntimid broken voice.\\n‘Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, \\nsincerely….’\\nBut he wanted to say something quite different.\\nHe crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her \\nshawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de \\ndames  shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ‘the fam -\\nily shawl.’ Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but \\nhe did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer -\\ntainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He \\nwas frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the \\nthought that Sonia meant to go with him.\\n‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, \\nstay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al -\\nmost resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use \\nof going in procession?’ he muttered going out.\\nSonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He \\nhad not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A \\npoignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.\\n‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as \\nhe went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all \\n… and not go?’\\nBut still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he \\nmustn’t ask himself questions. As he turned into the street \\nhe remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that \\nhe had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comnot daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped \\nshort for a moment.

I told \\nher—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi -\\nness! To tell her I was going ; but where was the need? Do I \\nlove her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog.

He moved away at last, not remem -\\nbering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the \\nsquare an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming \\nhim body and mind.\\nHe suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, ‘Go to the cross-\\nroads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have \\nsinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, ‘I \\nam a murderer.’’ He trembled, remembering that. And \\nthe hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especial -\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comly of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that \\nhe positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, \\ncomplete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a \\nsingle spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through \\nhim. Everything in him softened at once and the tears start -\\ned into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot….\\nHe knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down \\nto the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rap -\\nture. He got up and bowed down a second time.\\n‘He’s boozed,’ a youth near him observed.\\nThere was a roar of laughter.\\n‘He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye \\nto his children and his country. He’s bowing down to all \\nthe world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its \\npavement,’ added a workman who was a little drunk.\\n‘Quite a young man, too!’ observed a third.\\n‘And a gentleman,’ someone observed soberly.\\n‘There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t \\nnowadays.’\\nThese exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, \\nand the words, ‘I am a murderer,’ which were perhaps on \\nthe point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore \\nthese remarks quietly, however, and, without looking \\nround, he turned down a street leading to the police office. \\nHe had a glimpse of something on the way which did not \\nsurprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time \\nhe bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty \\npaces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him \\nbehind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18had followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at \\nthat moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with \\nhim for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, \\nwherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart … but he \\nwas just reaching the fatal place.\\nHe went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount \\nto the third storey. ‘I shall be some time going up,’ he \\nthought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far \\noff, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.\\nAgain the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about \\non the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again \\nthe same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming \\nfrom them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. \\nHis legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they \\nmoved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, \\nto collect himself, so as to enter like a man . ‘But why? what \\nfor?’ he wondered, reflecting. ‘If I must drink the cup what \\ndifference does it make? The more revolting the better.’ He \\nimagined for an instant the figure of the ‘explosive lieuten -\\nant,’ Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn’t \\nhe go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn’t he \\nturn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings? \\nAt least then it would be done privately…. No, no! To the ‘ex -\\nplosive lieutenant’! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\\nTurning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door \\nof the office. There were very few people in it this time—\\nonly a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not \\neven peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked \\ninto the next room. ‘Perhaps I still need not speak,’ passed \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthrough his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform \\nwas settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner anoth -\\ner clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of \\ncourse, Nikodim Fomitch.\\n‘No one in?’ Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person \\nat the bureau.\\n‘Whom do you want?’\\n‘A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but \\nI scent the Russian … how does it go on in the fairy tale … \\nI’ve forgotten! ‘At your service!’’ a familiar voice cried sud -\\ndenly.\\nRaskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood \\nbefore him. He had just come in from the third room. ‘It is \\nthe hand of fate,’ thought Raskolnikov. ‘Why is he here?’\\n‘You’ve come to see us? What about?’ cried Ilya Petro -\\nvitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour \\nand perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ‘If it’s on business you are \\nrather early.[*] It’s only a chance that I am here … however \\nI’ll do what I can.

He looked at him inquiringly, not \\nknowing how it would end.\\n‘I mean those crop-headed wenches,’ the talkative Ilya \\nPetrovitch continued. ‘Midwives is my name for them. I \\nthink it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Acad -\\nemy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young \\nlady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!’ Ilya Petrovitch \\nlaughed, quite pleased with his own wit. ‘It’s an immoderate \\nzeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. \\nWhy abuse it?

He ended by indicating the \\nstone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which \\nthe purse and the trinkets were found. The whole thing, in \\nfact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the judges were \\nvery much struck, among other things, by the fact that he Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, with -\\nout making use of them, and that, what was more, he did \\nnot now remember what the trinkets were like, or even how \\nmany there were. The fact that he had never opened the \\npurse and did not even know how much was in it seemed \\nincredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hun -\\ndred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being \\nso long under the stone, some of the most valuable notes \\nlying uppermost had suffered from the damp. They were a \\nlong while trying to discover why the accused man should \\ntell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made \\na truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some \\nof the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it \\nwas possible he had really not looked into the purse, and so \\ndidn’t know what was in it when he hid it under the stone. \\nBut they immediately drew the deduction that the crime \\ncould only have been committed through temporary men -\\ntal derangement, through homicidal mania, without object \\nor the pursuit of gain. This fell in with the most recent fash -\\nionable theory of temporary insanity, so often applied in \\nour days in criminal cases. Moreover Raskolnikov’s hypo -\\nchondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by \\nDr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and \\nher servant. All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that \\nRaskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and \\nrobber, but that there was another element in the case.\\nTo the intense annoyance of those who maintained this \\nopinion, the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. \\nTo the decisive question as to what motive impelled him \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comto the murder and the robbery, he answered very clearly \\nwith the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miser -\\nable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire \\nto provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three \\nthousand roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been \\nled to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature, \\nexasperated moreover by privation and failure. To the ques -\\ntion what led him to confess, he answered that it was his \\nheartfelt repentance. All this was almost coarse….\\nThe sentence however was more merciful than could have \\nbeen expected, perhaps partly because the criminal had not \\ntried to justify himself, but had rather shown a desire to \\nexaggerate his guilt. All the strange and peculiar circum -\\nstances of the crime were taken into consideration. There \\ncould be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken \\ncondition of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had \\nmade no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to \\nthe effect of remorse, partly to his abnormal mental con -\\ndition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the murder of \\nLizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man \\ncommits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Fi -\\nnally, the confession, at the very moment when the case was \\nhopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay \\nthrough melancholy and fanaticism, and when, moreover, \\nthere were no proofs against the real criminal, no suspi -\\ncions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word) —all \\nthis did much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, \\ntoo, in the prisoner’s favour came out quite unexpectedly. \\nRazumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor \\nconsumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny \\non supporting him for six months, and when this student \\ndied, leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained \\nalmost from his thirteenth year, Raskolnikov had got the \\nold man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he \\ndied. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when \\nthey had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskol -\\nnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire \\nand was burnt in doing so. This was investigated and fairly \\nwell confirmed by many witnesses. These facts made an im -\\npression in his favour.\\nAnd in the end the criminal was, in consideration of ex -\\ntenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in \\nthe second class for a term of eight years only.\\nAt the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s moth -\\ner fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get \\nher out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin chose a \\ntown on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be \\nable to follow every step of the trial and at the same time \\nto see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible.

Dounia saw at last that it was hard \\nto deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was bet -\\nter to be absolutely silent on certain points; but it became \\nmore and more evident that the poor mother suspected \\nsomething terrible. Dounia remembered her brother’s tell -\\ning her that her mother had overheard her talking in her \\nsleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and \\nbefore the fatal day of the confession: had not she made out \\nsomething from that? Sometimes days and even weeks of \\ngloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period \\nof hysterical animation, and the invalid would begin to talk \\nalmost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his future…. \\nHer fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured \\nher, pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they \\nwere pretending), but she still went on talking.\\nFive months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sen -\\ntenced. Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often \\nas it was possible. At last the moment of separation came. \\nDounia swore to her brother that the separation should not \\nbe for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in his \\nyouthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations \\nat least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four \\nyears, and saving up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a \\ncountry rich in every natural resource and in need of work -\\ners, active men and capital. There they would settle in the \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comtown where Rodya was and all together would begin a new \\nlife. They all wept at parting.\\nRaskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. \\nHe asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly \\nanxious about her. He worried so much about her that it \\nalarmed Dounia. When he heard about his mother’s illness \\nhe became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly re -\\nserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by \\nSvidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to \\nfollow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to \\nSiberia. Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on \\nthe subject, but both knew it would be so. At the final leave-\\ntaking he smiled strangely at his sister’s and Razumihin’s \\nfervent anticipations of their happy future together when \\nhe should come out of prison. He predicted that their moth -\\ner’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at \\nlast set off.\\nTwo months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It \\nwas a quiet and sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and \\nZossimov were invited however. During all this period Ra -\\nzumihin wore an air of resolute determination. Dounia put \\nimplicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she \\ncould not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength \\nof will. Among other things he began attending university \\nlectures again in order to take his degree. They were contin -\\nually making plans for the future; both counted on settling \\nin Siberia within five years at least. Till then they rested \\ntheir hopes on Sonia.\\nPulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her bless -Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18ing to Dounia’s marriage with Razumihin; but after the \\nmarriage she became even more melancholy and anxious. \\nTo give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov \\nhad looked after the poor student and his decrepit father \\nand how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescu -\\ning two little children from a fire.

She told them \\nthat, although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, \\nas it were, shut himself off from everyone—he took a very \\ndirect and simple view of his new life; that he understood \\nhis position, expected nothing better for the time, had no \\nill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and \\nscarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, \\nso unlike anything he had known before. She wrote that \\nhis health was satisfactory; he did his work without shirk -\\ning or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent about \\nfood, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so \\nbad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from \\nher, Sonia, to have his own tea every day. He begged her \\nnot to trouble about anything else, declaring that all this \\nfuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote further that \\nin prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she \\nhad not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that \\nthey were crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept \\non a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to \\nmake any other arrangement. But that he lived so poorly \\nand roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply from \\ninattention and indifference.\\nSonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no inter -\\nest in her visits, had almost been vexed with her indeed for \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comcoming, unwilling to talk and rude to her. But that in the \\nend these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity \\nfor him, so that he was positively distressed when she was \\nill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see \\nhim on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, \\nto which he was brought for a few minutes to see her. On \\nworking days she would go to see him at work either at the \\nworkshops or at the brick kilns, or at the sheds on the banks \\nof the Irtish.\\nAbout herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in \\nmaking some acquaintances in the town, that she did sew -\\ning, and, as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, \\nshe was looked upon as an indispensable person in many \\nhouses.

He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed \\nto see how they all loved life and prized it. It seemed to him \\nthat they loved and valued life more in prison than in free -\\ndom. What terrible agonies and privations some of them, \\nthe tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so \\nmuch for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold \\nspring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp \\nhad marked three years before, and longed to see again, as \\nhe might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass \\nround it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he \\nsaw still more inexplicable examples.\\nIn prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not \\nsee and did not want to see; he lived as it were with down -\\ncast eyes. It was loathsome and unbearable for him to look. \\nBut in the end there was much that surprised him and he \\nbegan, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he had \\nnot suspected before. What surprised him most of all was \\nthe terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the \\nrest. They seemed to be a different species, and he looked \\nat them and they at him with distrust and hostility. He felt \\nand knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never \\nhave admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and \\nstrong. There were some Polish exiles, political prisoners, \\namong them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as \\nignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them \\nlike that. He saw that these ignorant men were in many re -\\nspects far wiser than the Poles. There were some Russians Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x180who were just as contemptuous, a former officer and two \\nseminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly. He \\nwas disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to \\nhate him at last—why, he could not tell. Men who had been \\nfar more guilty despised and laughed at his crime.\\n‘You’re a gentleman,’ they used to say. ‘You shouldn’t hack \\nabout with an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.’\\nThe second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacra -\\nment with his gang. He went to church and prayed with the \\nothers. A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how. \\nAll fell on him at once in a fury.\\n‘You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,’ they shouted. \\n‘You ought to be killed.’\\nHe had never talked to them about God nor his belief, \\nbut they wanted to kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. \\nOne of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy. Ras -\\nkolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did \\nnot quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard succeeded in \\nintervening between him and his assailant, or there would \\nhave been bloodshed.\\nThere was another question he could not decide: why \\nwere they all so fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their \\nfavour; she rarely met them, sometimes only she came to \\nsee him at work for a moment. And yet everybody knew \\nher, they knew that she had come out to follow him knew \\nhow and where she lived. She never gave them money, did \\nthem no particular services. Only once at Christmas she \\nsent them all presents of pies and rolls. But by degrees clos -\\ner relations sprang up between them and Sonia. She would \\x18\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwrite and post letters for them to their relations.

And when \\nshe visited Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the pris -\\noners on the road, they all took off their hats to her. ‘Little \\nmother Sofya Semyonovna, you are our dear, good little \\nmother,’ coarse branded criminals said to that frail little \\ncreature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone \\nwas delighted when she smiled.

They accused one another, fought and killed each \\nother. There were conflagrations and famine. All men and \\nall things were involved in destruction. The plague spread \\nand moved further and further. Only a few men could be \\nsaved in the whole world. They were a pure chosen people, \\ndestined to found a new race and a new life, to renew and \\npurify the earth, but no one had seen these men, no one had \\nheard their words and their voices.\\nRaskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream \\nhaunted his memory so miserably, the impression of this \\nfeverish delirium persisted so long. The second week after \\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comEaster had come. There were warm bright spring days; in \\nthe prison ward the grating windows under which the sen -\\ntinel paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit \\nhim twice during his illness; each time she had to obtain \\npermission, and it was difficult. But she often used to come \\nto the hospital yard, especially in the evening, sometimes \\nonly to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the \\nward.\\nOne evening, when he was almost well again, Raskol -\\nnikov fell asleep. On waking up he chanced to go to the \\nwindow, and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospi -\\ntal gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone. Something \\nstabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and \\nmoved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, \\nnor the day after; he noticed that he was expecting her un -\\neasily. At last he was discharged. On reaching the prison he \\nlearnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying \\nill at home and was unable to go out.\\nHe was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon \\nlearnt that her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he \\nwas anxious about her, Sonia sent him a pencilled note, tell -\\ning him that she was much better, that she had a slight cold \\nand that she would soon, very soon come and see him at his \\nwork. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\\nAgain it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, \\nat six o’clock, he went off to work on the river bank, where \\nthey used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln \\nfor baking it in a shed. There were only three of them sent. \\nOne of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and \\nlaying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on \\nto the river bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed \\nand began gazing at the wide deserted river. From the high \\nbank a broad landscape opened before him, the sound of \\nsinging floated faintly audible from the other bank. In the \\nvast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black \\nspecks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there \\nother men were living, utterly unlike those here; there time \\nitself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham \\nand his flocks had not passed. Raskolnikov sat gazing, his \\nthoughts passed into day-dreams, into contemplation; he \\nthought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and \\ntroubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she \\nhad come up noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was \\nstill quite early; the morning chill was still keen. She wore \\nher poor old burnous and the green shawl; her face still \\nshowed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave \\nhim a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand with \\nher usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out \\nher hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as \\nthough afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand \\nas though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet \\nher and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her \\nvisit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away \\ndeeply grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole \\na rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground \\nwithout speaking. They were alone, no one had seen them. \\nThe guard had turned away for the time.\\x18\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comHow it happened he did not know. But all at once some -\\nthing seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept \\nand threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant \\nshe was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped \\nup and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment \\nshe understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into \\nher eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her be -\\nyond everything and that at last the moment had come….\\nThey wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their \\neyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces \\nwere bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full res -\\nurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the \\nheart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the \\nother.\\nThey resolved to wait and be patient. They had another \\nseven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what \\ninfinite happiness before them! But he had risen again and \\nhe knew it and felt it in all his being, while she—she only \\nlived in his life.\\nOn the evening of the same day, when the barracks were \\nlocked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of \\nher. He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who \\nhad been his enemies looked at him differently; he had \\neven entered into talk with them and they answered him \\nin a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought \\nit was bound to be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be \\nchanged?\\nHe thought of her. He remembered how continually he \\nhad tormented her and wounded her heart. He remembered Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18\\x18her pale and thin little face. But these recollections scarcely \\ntroubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would \\nnow repay all her sufferings. And what were all, all the ago -\\nnies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence \\nand imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of \\nfeeling an external, strange fact with which he had no con -\\ncern. But he could not think for long together of anything \\nthat evening, and he could not have analysed anything con -\\nsciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped into the \\nplace of theory and something quite different would work \\nitself out in his mind.\\nUnder his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up \\nmechanically. The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one \\nfrom which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him. At \\nfirst he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, \\nwould talk about the gospel and pester him with books.
